# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

- The OpenGateway model catalog now matches the gateway: it updates limits, prices, or capabilities for 2 models.

### Fixed

- Cursor's `resource_exhausted` signatures (`isCursorZeroTokenResourceExhausted`, `isCursorPayloadResourceExhausted`, `isCursorQuotaResourceExhausted`) now match only the `cursor` and `cursor-cli-oauth` providers, so another provider's `resource_exhausted` rate or usage limit is no longer read as a Cursor payload overflow or re-mint; a rate-limited body that says its limit resets in N minutes now yields that wait as the retry hint ([#2660](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2660)).

### Removed

## [2026.10.5] - 2026-10-03

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Models can declare `supportsAssistantPrefill`, and `modelSupportsAssistantPrefill(model, { thinkingEnabled })` reports whether a request may end with an assistant message the model continues (never with extended thinking on the Anthropic Messages API); no built-in model declares it yet ([#1930](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1930)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- A first-turn forced `tool_choice` that a strict-schema gateway refuses by naming the forced tool (its `tools.N` index or quoted name in a 400) is retried once without the forced choice, like the other forced-choice refusals, so a new session's first message no longer fails there; an unrelated 400 still fails ([#2648](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2648), reported by [@rhyme227](https://github.com/rhyme227) in code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent#9507).

## [2026.10.2] - 2026-10-02

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added the inherited lightweight `@earendil-works/pi-ai/models` entry point for model collections and provider construction without loading TypeBox, built-in catalogs, or provider SDKs.

- Added inherited Anthropic workload identity federation from the Anthropic SDK environment variables `ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID`, `ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID`, and `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` (plus optional `ANTHROPIC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`). API keys and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` take precedence ([#10177](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10177), [#10242](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/10242) by [@philfreo](https://github.com/philfreo)).

- Added an inherited copy code login method to Anthropic OAuth, next to the fork's browser login with manual code fallback. Copy code login shows the authorization code on Anthropic's page for pasting and works when the browser runs on another machine ([#10194](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/10194) by [@lucasmeijer](https://github.com/lucasmeijer)).

- OpenGateway models refresh at runtime once OpenGateway is configured: a chat model the gateway starts serving appears without a senpi release when the gateway publishes its price and context window (or it is a serving tier of a shipped model), sized and priced from the gateway's own listing and price table; a model the gateway retires or stops listing disappears. A failed refresh keeps the last good list. ([#2552](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2552))
### Changed

- OAuth browser pages show the logo in color (inherited).

- The OpenGateway catalog now takes context windows, max output, and prices from the gateway itself, and `-ultrafast` serving tiers inherit their base model's capabilities. It adds `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-ultrafast`, `z-ai/glm-5.3-ultrafast`, and `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash-ultrafast`, and corrects 20 models, including `moonshotai/kimi-k3-ultrafast` (max output 20,480), `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` (max output 64,000), `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` (context 200,000), and the DeepSeek, GLM, and Qwen prices the gateway bills. A daily job now opens a refresh PR whenever the gateway's catalog changes. ([#2552](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2552))
### Fixed

- A request that replays a `tool_reference` and is rejected by an Anthropic-compatible relay with `400 Tool reference ... not found in available tools` is retried once with the replay turned into text, and the tools those references named stay callable. Thanks to @ldz281. ([#2568](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2568), [#2574](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/2574))

- Fixed inherited context overflow detection for Z.AI CN endpoint `Prompt exceeds max length` errors ([#10208](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10208)).

- Anthropic requests no longer fail when a `strict: "prefer"` tool schema uses keywords Anthropic strict tool use rejects, such as `minimum`/`maximum`; such tools are sent non-strict through the shared constrained-sampling policy (inherited, [#9953](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9953)).

- OpenAI Responses requests no longer fail with `Expected an ID that begins with 'ctc'` when replaying grammar tool calls from another provider or a gateway (inherited).

- Regenerating model catalogs without `--strict` while OpenGateway is unreachable keeps the last good OpenGateway catalog instead of shipping it empty. ([#2552](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2552))
- A faux provider registered through `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` now keeps answering after `resetApiProviders()`, which a session reload runs, both globally and inside the provider scope it was registered in. Before, a request sent after a reload failed with "No API provider registered", and when the faux API id contained a word the retry classifier treats as transient, the failure sat in a retry backoff for over 15 seconds. ([#2542](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2542))

### Changed

- The bundled Claude Code floor that Anthropic OAuth requests advertise when the latest published version is unknown is now 2.1.286. ([#2481](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2481))

### Fixed

- Toggle-only reasoning models now expose only their supported thinking states: GLM, Kimi, DeepSeek and Qwen catalog rows whose API accepts thinking on or off (not an effort level) offer `off` and enabled thinking instead of a fabricated `minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`xhigh`/`max` ladder, while models with explicit effort metadata keep their declared ladders. Contributed by @effortprogrammer. ([#891](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/891))

### Removed

## [2026.10.1] - 2026-10-01

### Breaking Changes

- Changed the inherited provider-facing `ProviderStreams` and `StreamFunction` inputs from `Context` to normalized `TranscriptContext` values. System prompts and tool declarations now live in transcript system messages; custom providers read them with `getCurrentSystemPrompt()` and `getCurrentTools()`. The fork's `activeToolNames` rides on `TranscriptContext` and survives `normalizeContext()` ([#9548](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/9548)).

- Restricted inherited `ToolCall.arguments` and `ToolResultMessage.details` to JSON-compatible values, changed `ToolResultMessage` into a conditional type, and made `JsonValue` arrays readonly. `ToolResultMessage<unknown>` resolves to `never`; use `ToolResultMessage` or `ToolResultMessage<JsonValue>`.

- Image models are inherited onto the regular `Provider`/`Models` surface as `ImageModel` with a required `type: "image"`: use `models.getModelOfType("image", ...)`, `models.generateImages()` and `createProvider({ models, images })`. The generated model data schema is version 6, so every entry carries `type` and one upstream ID can have separate chat, image and classifier entries. The fork keeps `ImagesModel`, `ImagesApi` and `KnownImagesApi` as aliases of the new names.

- The inherited `TranscriptContext` is branded, so only `normalizeContext()` produces it and a raw `Context` no longer type-checks where a provider stream or the agent `StreamFn` expects one; it has no `systemPrompt` field because the system prompt travels as the leading system message.

### Added

- Added `ultrafast` as an OpenAI Responses and ChatGPT Subscription request tier, with support for all five Astra reasoning efforts (`low` through `max`). The published 6x Standard price applies to GPT-6 Astra only; any other model keeps its base rate. ([#2410](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/2410) by [@audreyt](https://github.com/audreyt))

- Added inherited transcript-backed mid-conversation system prompt and tool changes, replayed natively on models that accept mid-conversation system messages and collapsed for other providers ([#9548](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/9548)).

- Added the inherited optional model `type` (`"chat"`, `"image"` or `"classifier"`), `isModelType()` and `getModelType()`, and `getModelsOfType()`, `getModelOfType()`, `getAvailableOfType()`, `getAllModels()` and `getAllAvailable()` on `Models`. Chat models may omit `type`, so existing chat models, providers and stores keep working.

- Added inherited classifier models and `Models.classify()` with a provider-neutral `choice`/`score`/`bool` contract and token usage on `ClassifierResult`. The built-in TypeSafe provider (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`) serves `jev-latest`; Jev models are also listed on OpenRouter, Cloudflare Workers AI, Vercel AI Gateway and OpenCode Zen, and the `llama-cpp-classify` API answers from llama-server next-token probabilities.

- Added the inherited Meta provider (Model API key `META_API_KEY` and Muse subscription sign-in) with Muse Spark models ([#9096](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/9096) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).

- Added inherited `onProviderStreamEvent` to observe parsed provider stream events before normalization, including provider-specific fields that assistant messages do not keep ([#9784](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9784), [#9901](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/9901) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

- Added the inherited optional `AssistantMessage.thinkingLevel`, which records the thinking level the agent loop requested for a response.

- Added inherited per-model image-input limits and cache-safe resize metadata to the generated catalog ([#9631](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9631)).

- Added inherited array-based `models.all.json` and `providers/{id}.all.json` catalog variants that allow one upstream ID per model type; the keyed `models.json` and `providers/{id}.json` stay chat-only.

- Added an inherited runtime chat-model check to the `Models` stream entry points, so non-chat models fail with a clear `ModelsError`.

### Changed

- The bundled Claude Code floor that Anthropic OAuth requests advertise when the latest published version is unknown is now 2.1.285. ([#752](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/752))

- ChatGPT Subscription requests now send the `x-codex-routing-hint` header that codex sends (`model=<id>`, plus `;tier=<tier>` when a service tier is requested), on both SSE requests and the WebSocket handshake. ([#2410](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/2410))

- ChatGPT Subscription, OpenRouter and Radius browser sign-in share the inherited callback server, which rejects provider authorization-error redirects and falls back to pasting the redirect URL when the callback port is in use. The OAuth page helpers are available as `utils/oauth-page`. The provider id stays `chatgpt-subscription`; the upstream "OpenAI Codex (legacy)" rename and Sign in with ChatGPT on the `openai` provider are not adopted.

- Radius browser sign-in exchanges the authorization code before showing the browser page, so token exchange failures appear in the browser (inherited).

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited 1-hour Anthropic cache writes reported by Vercel AI Gateway in streaming deltas being priced at the 5-minute rate ([#9210](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9210)), and Amazon Bedrock one-hour cache writes priced at the five-minute rate ([#9457](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9457)).

- Fixed inherited model-level `samplingParams` being dropped by direct `stream()`/`complete()` calls on OpenAI-compatible APIs ([#9506](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9506)).

- Fixed inherited Mistral GLM models producing empty text blocks and split thinking blocks from empty content deltas ([#9674](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9674)), and Mistral reasoning models ignoring the requested thinking level ([#9678](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9678)).

- Fixed inherited OpenAI Fast mode requests being priced at the standard rate when the response reports `service_tier: "fast"` ([#10034](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10034)).

- Fixed inherited OpenCode Zen and OpenCode Go `qwen3.8-flash` thinking being replayed as plain text on later turns ([#10047](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10047)).

- Fixed inherited OpenAI Responses streams returning unfinished tool calls as runnable when a server omits `output_index`, such as llama.cpp; those streams now end with an error ([#9974](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9974)).

- Fixed inherited GitHub Copilot Claude Opus 5.5 offering unsupported thinking levels when upstream model metadata is incomplete, and GitHub Copilot GPT models using the Chat Completions adapter instead of the Responses adapter ([#9253](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/9253) by [@petrroll](https://github.com/petrroll)).

- Fixed inherited image-only user messages being rejected by some OpenAI-compatible providers because they included an empty text part ([#9797](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9797)).

- Fixed inherited unknown OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoints receiving strict tool schemas unless they advertise support ([#9816](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9816)), and Cerebras models advertising unsupported strict tool schemas ([#9804](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/9804) by [@EdenGottlieb](https://github.com/EdenGottlieb)).

- Fixed inherited z.ai `Prompt too long` errors not being recognized as context overflow ([#9805](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9805)), and bodyless HTTP 400/413 errors from non-Cerebras providers being misclassified as context overflow ([#9482](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9482)).

- Fixed inherited DeepSeek V4.1 thinking levels on OpenRouter and OpenCode Go ([#9485](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9485)), Vercel AI Gateway replaying unsigned thinking as assistant text ([#9676](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9676)), and Google Generative AI and Vertex AI using unsupported thinking levels ([#9455](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9455)).

- Fixed inherited Anthropic-compatible relays breaking signed thinking replay when they report a different response model ([#9188](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9188)).

- Fixed inherited OpenAI-compatible Responses errors to name the actual provider ([#9298](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9298)), Baseten requests to send session-affinity headers from `sessionId` ([#9629](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9629)), and retry classification for Cloudflare 520 responses ([#9627](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9627)) and transient Azure peak-load errors ([#9669](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9669)).

- Custom OpenAI-compatible models now inherit native `max` reasoning support from any built-in catalog entry with the same id after authoritative discovered/model effort maps are considered, while the existing GPT and Claude id lists remain a floor. Thanks @hunghoang3011. ([#2456](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2456))

### Changed

- The `anthropic-subscription` (Claude SDK) lane now reports the prompt-cache TTL Claude Code actually uses: 1 hour on a Claude subscription, 5 minutes when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` or a Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry switch puts Claude Code on API, gateway or cloud billing. `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL`, `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M` and `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H` are honored the way Claude Code honors them. Cache-aware waits sized from the TTL (the prompt-cache safe-wait budget) grow accordingly on a subscription. ([code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent#8759](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/issues/8759))

## [2026.9.29-5] - 2026-09-29

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- GPT-6.1 Sol (`gpt-6.1-sol`, released 2026-09-29) joins the catalog on OpenAI, ChatGPT Subscription, Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode Zen, OpenRouter (`openai/gpt-6.1-sol`, `-pro`, `:batch`), Venice (`openai-gpt-61-sol`) and Vercel AI Gateway, with `-fast` Fast-tier (`service_tier: priority`, 2x list price at request time) variants on OpenAI and ChatGPT Subscription. It carries its published prices (\$2/\$10 per 1M tokens with \$0.10 cache reads and \$2.50 cache writes, doubling input and 1.5x output past 272k), 128k output, text and image input, tool search, additional tools and mid-session `configuration_update` support on both first-party lanes, and the documented effort ladder `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max` — `none` and `minimal` are not offered, so `off` is not selectable and a map-less `gpt-6.1-sol` row from a custom provider is inferred the same way. Its project prompt budget is 400k, like GPT-6 Sol. Ultrafast is not added: OpenAI does not offer it for GPT-6.1 Sol yet. ([#2390](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2390))

- `classifyErrorMessage` / `isRetryableAssistantError` treat an Anthropic `forbidden` error whose message is only `Request not allowed` as retryable; `permission_error` and forbidden rejections that carry a reason stay terminal. ([#2376](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2376))

## [2026.9.29-3] - 2026-09-29

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- A provider module that disappeared because the installed package was replaced while the session was running now ends the turn once with `The installed package changed while this session was running, so <file> can no longer be loaded. Restart and resume this session to continue.`, instead of the same `Cannot find module` failure on every retry and fallback model. ([#2358](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2358))

### Removed

## [2026.9.29-2] - 2026-09-29

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Cursor tool calls run once in the npm package. The bundle's Cursor provider carried its own copy of the marker that tells the agent loop a call was already executed, so every tool Cursor ran was run a second time under the same id and a replayed stale write could revert a file the model had already fixed. The same split also kept the Cursor conversation cache from being released when a session closed, and kept the context ceiling Cursor reports from reaching the running session until a restart. ([#2334](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2334))

- Native OpenAI Responses requests no longer fail every turn with `Tool choice 'web_search' not found in 'tools' parameter.` when hosted web search replaces the `web_search` function tool ([#2234](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2234)).

- Fixed Bedrock Converse requests rejecting tool schemas with root `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `allOf`, or a missing object type, while preserving parameter alternatives and strict sampling ([#1947](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1947)).

- Rejected OpenAI Responses WebSocket requests now show the provider's HTTP status and error message instead of `Error Code undefined: undefined` ([#2235](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2235)).

- Adjacent user messages sent through the OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions adapter are folded into one ordered message for non-OpenAI hosts, while direct OpenAI requests retain their existing message boundaries. ([#2120](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2120))

### Removed

## [2026.9.29] - 2026-09-29

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Claude Sonnet 5.5 (`claude-sonnet-5-5`) is in the catalog for `anthropic` (1M context, 128k output, $2 / $10 per MTok, cache reads $0.20, effort low through max) and for Bedrock (`global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5-5`), OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, Venice and OpenCode. Like Claude Opus 5.5 it runs adaptive thinking only, so a thinking-off turn pins `effort: low` instead of sending `thinking.type=disabled`, and `tool_choice` `any` / `tool` are never sent to it. ([#2321](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2321))

### Changed

- Anthropic OAuth requests identify as the latest published Claude Code instead of a version fixed at build time: the bundled floor is now 2.1.284 (Claude Sonnet 5.5 needs it), and the host refreshes the version in the background from Anthropic's `latest` release channel and the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` npm dist-tag at most every six hours, cached under the agent directory. No request waits on the lookup and an offline host advertises the floor. `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION=X.Y.Z` pins the advertised version. ([#2321](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2321))

### Fixed

- `isContextOverflow` classifies the `anthropic-subscription` refusal "The conversation is too long to resend (about N tokens, limit M). Compacting it and retrying." as a context overflow, so overflow recovery compacts and retries it. ([code-yeongyu/senpi#2329](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2329))

- A `claude_code_version_too_old` rejection on an Anthropic OAuth request now raises the advertised version to the one Anthropic names and retries the request once, so a model released after the last senpi build works the first time it is asked for. If the retry still fails, the error names the version senpi advertised and how to pin a newer one. ([#2321](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2321))

- `AuthResult` and `AuthCheck` carry `ambient: true` when Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex auth came only from a shared cloud credential chain (AWS profile/keys/roles in the environment, Application Default Credentials), so callers can rank those providers below ones the user configured. ([#2327](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2327))

### Fixed

- GitHub Copilot Business and Enterprise accounts no longer have requests sent to the individual host (`421 Misdirected Request`): the API host now comes from the token exchange's own `endpoints.api` (bound to that token), then the token's `proxy-ep`, then the GitHub Enterprise domain, with the individual host only as a last resort. This covers login and refresh (`/models`, model policies), inference, and a Copilot token passed as a key (`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` or an explicit `apiKey`). A 421 now says the request reached another plan's host and includes the GitHub request id. ([#2309](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2309))

- The bundled Devin model seed lists exactly the SWE-2 lanes Devin serves: `swe-2-high`, `swe-2-medium` and `swe-2-max`. `swe-2-low` and `swe-2-high-lite`, which appear only inside the Devin CLI binary and are refused with `permission_denied`, are removed, so a config naming them no longer resolves silently.

### Changed

### Fixed

- GitHub Copilot requests now keep at most 128 serialized tools on Chat Completions, Responses, and Anthropic Messages routes while retaining any explicitly forced tool. Excess definitions are omitted deterministically with a diagnostic instead of reaching Copilot as an opaque HTTP 400, and a generic `400 Bad Request` after limiting now explains the likely tool-cap mismatch on all three routes. ([#2298](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2298))
- GitHub Copilot OAuth login and refresh now keep the account's `GET /models` prompt, context, and output limits and apply them to available models instead of retaining larger native models.dev limits; the exact `model_max_prompt_tokens_exceeded` rejection is also classified as context overflow so the existing compact-and-retry recovery runs. ([#2299](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2299))
- A GitHub Copilot 403 or 402 now says what happened instead of `403 status code (no body)`: quota exhaustion (402, or 429 `quota_exceeded`) is named as such, a refusal says the body was empty, and both carry the GitHub request id. GitHub Copilot declares 401/403 as token-refusal statuses so a runtime can re-exchange a revoked Copilot token, and a failed Copilot `openai-responses` request now records its HTTP status in `providerDiagnostic`. Request ids no longer influence retry classification. ([#2297](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2297))

### Removed

## [2026.9.28-4] - 2026-09-28

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- `openai-completions` and `openai-responses` models accept `compat.supportsForcedToolChoice`; `false` drops a forced `tool_choice` before the request is sent. ([#2218](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2218))

### Changed

### Fixed

- Re-logging in to an auth-blocked Claude subscription account now actually refreshes it. The login exchanged fresh tokens and reported success, but the credential-pool merge kept the stored slot for any name it already knew, so the revoked token and its `auth_error` block stayed on disk. A same-name slot with strictly newer material now replaces the stored copy; sibling accounts that rotated or were blocked during the browser round trip are still never rewound. ([#2222](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2222))
- `openai-responses` retries once without `tool_choice` when the provider rejects a forced choice with a "not supported"-class 400 (matching `openai-completions`), and the classifier also recognises `not currently supported` and the auto-only refusal `only \`"auto"\` is supported for \`tool_choice\``. ([#2224](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2224))
- A provider that refuses a forced `tool_choice` with only automatic tool choice allowed (Kiro: `Kiro supports only automatic tool choice or tool_choice:none`) gets the request once more without it instead of failing, and a model whose refusal was retried successfully gets no forced `tool_choice` for the rest of the process, on `openai-completions`, `openai-responses`, and `anthropic-messages`. Refusals that blame thinking are retried each time rather than remembered. ([#2218](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2218))

- `parseEndpointReasoningEfforts()` maps the `reasoning_efforts` an OpenAI-compatible `/models` entry advertises onto senpi's thinking levels, and `Model` has an optional `defaultThinkingLevel`. ([#2196](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2196))
- `isQuotaExhaustionMessage()` recognises the same account quota, budget, credit, and billing exhaustion wording the retry classifier treats as terminal. ([#2198](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2198))

### Changed

### Fixed

- A terminal 429 or 503 error from an OpenAI-compatible (or Azure, Google, OpenRouter) provider keeps the provider's `Retry-After` (seconds or HTTP-date) as the `(retry-after-ms: N)` marker, so callers can honour it even when no retry ran.

- Failed assistant messages carry an optional `providerDiagnostic` (`category`: `auth` | `rate_limit` | `quota` | `context_limit` | `invalid_request` | `provider_unavailable` | `unknown`, plus `httpStatus`, allowlisted `code` and `evidence`) so SDK consumers can tell provider failure families apart without parsing `errorMessage`. The Anthropic Messages and OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions adapters mint it only from the SDK's HTTP error status and error code or an explicit SSE error envelope; contradictory evidence yields no diagnostic. `sanitizeProviderDiagnostic` and `readProviderDiagnostic` revalidate values that crossed a boundary. `errorMessage`, retries and fallback are unchanged.

- A forced `tool_choice` refused because extended thinking is on now falls back to a request without `tool_choice` instead of failing the turn: Anthropic Messages "Thinking may not be enabled when tool_choice forces tool use" and the OpenAI-compatible gateway wording for always-thinking Claude models ("tool_choice cannot force tool use") join the classifier behind the one-shot retry. ([#2121](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2121))
- Replayed `reasoning_details` entries are now built from the OpenAI Chat Completions input schema instead of echoing the stored object, so a key the schema does not define — a streaming ordinal, a delta id, any field a provider adds later — can no longer reach a provider and wedge the conversation. Each entry carries `type`, its optional `id` and `format`, and exactly the payload its type defines (`text` plus optional `signature`, `summary`, or `data`); `null` survives where the schema allows it, array order still carries the sequence, and stored signatures are untouched, so sessions already on disk recover with no migration. This generalizes the `index`-only fix from #2122. ([#2125](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2125))
- Replayed `reasoning_details` no longer carry the streaming-assembly `index` field on OpenAI Chat Completions requests. A gateway that rejects an input reasoning entry holding `index` ("the reasoning_details at position N entry 0 must not contain streaming index") wedged the conversation permanently, because the merged array is persisted in the assistant block and replayed on every later request. The field is stripped when the request is built, so sessions already on disk recover with no migration, and that rejection is now classified retryable so retry and the model-fallback chain can unwedge an affected session instead of ending the turn. ([#2122](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2122))
- An assistant message replayed to an OpenAI Chat Completions provider no longer grows a property whose name is the serialized `reasoning_details` array. The thinking block's signature slot holds either a reasoning field name or serialized reasoning details, and only a known field name (`reasoning`, `reasoning_content`, `reasoning_text`) may name a property, so the reasoning is no longer duplicated into every later request. ([#2122](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2122))
- OpenAI Responses GPT-5.6+ requests send `prompt_cache_options.comparison_response_id` only when the previous same-provider, same-model response id begins with `resp`; the platform rejects other ids with HTTP 400. ([#2118](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2118))
- Amazon Bedrock and Google Gemini requests no longer carry adjacent same-role messages: the Bedrock Converse and Gemini converters fold a message whose role matches the previous one into it (blocks in order, Bedrock cache point still last), so the hidden environment-context user message before a prompt, or a prompt after tool results, no longer breaks those providers' user/assistant alternation rule. ([#2114](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2114))

### Removed

### Added

- `@earendil-works/pi-ai/utils/tool-name-match` exports `resolveToolNameMatch`, the lenient tool-name matcher shared by the agent loop's tool-call correction and the Anthropic tool-reference repair. It folds case and `-`/`_`, strips an `mcp_`/`mcp__` namespace on either side, and resolves only on a unique match. ([#2111](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2111))
- `compat.supportsConfigurationUpdate` on OpenAI Responses models marks models that accept `configuration_update` input items, and `supportsConfigurationUpdate(model)` reads it. The catalog sets it on the `openai` GPT-5.6 and GPT-6 rows (including `-fast`) and on `chatgpt-subscription` `gpt-6-astra` / `gpt-6-astra-fast`; mid-session effort changes on those models go through the item instead of a top-level `reasoning.effort` change. ([#2094](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2094))
- OpenAI Responses models with the new `supportsAllowedTools` compat flag (set on the GPT-5.6+ OpenAI catalog rows) keep every declared tool in `tools` and restrict the callable subset named by the new `Context.activeToolNames` through `tool_choice: allowed_tools` (`none` when the subset is empty), so removing a tool no longer invalidates the prompt cache. `supportsAllowedToolChoice(model)` reports the flag. ([#2095](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2095))

- `warmPromptCache` prewarms native OpenAI Responses GPT-5.6+ models with `prompt_cache_options.prewarm` (system prompt + tools, no conversation), and those requests now send `prompt_cache_options.comparison_response_id` for the previous same-model response and record the returned `prompt_cache_diagnostics` on `AssistantMessage.promptCacheDiagnostics`. On these models (unless `cacheRetention` is `none`) the system prompt is sent as one `input_text` block with `prompt_cache_breakpoint: { mode: "explicit" }`, so a prewarmed or previous prefix is read even when the hosted `web_search_preview` tool is present. ([#2096](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2096))

### Changed

### Fixed

- OpenAI Completions and Responses usage parsers count gateway `cache_creation_tokens` as `cacheWrite` when `cache_write_tokens` is absent, so those writes are no longer billed as uncached input. ([#2091](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2091))

- OpenAI GPT-5.6+ Responses and Completions requests to `api.openai.com` no longer send a per-session `prompt_cache_key`, so sessions, forks, and task children can reuse the same cached prefix. Pre-5.6 models still send the session key. ([#2097](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2097))

- `resolvePromptCacheTtlSeconds()` returns 1800 s for GPT-5.6 and later (GPT-6 Sol/Luna/Astra included) on the OpenAI, Azure OpenAI and ChatGPT-subscription Responses lanes, matching OpenAI's documented minimum 30-minute cache lifetime; earlier OpenAI models and gateways that proxy the same ids keep 300 s. Direct DeepSeek no longer reports a fixed 5-minute TTL: the new `resolvePromptCacheLifetime()` classifies its automatic cache as `best-effort`, next to `ttl` and `none`, and the numeric resolver returns `undefined` for it.

- Cursor suffix families the 2026-08-18 alias snapshot does not list (`grok-4.7`, `claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-fable-5-1` and its thinking variants, `gemini-3.8-flash`, `muse-spark-1.3`) group into one selectable identity with reasoning levels, derived from the live `GetUsableModels` batch, instead of arriving as flat singletons with reasoning off. The identity offers exactly the levels the server listed (an unlisted level is unsupported and clamps to a listed one), and an explicit level resolves to the exact server-listed variant id instead of silently downgrading to the representative. A derived family never takes an id that is already a static identity, a static alias key, or a raw catalog id; those members stay flat. Stored flat variants regroup on restore, and a stored group, static or derived, keeps its levels and representative whichever side of its flat aliases it was stored on. The context window is unchanged: a family without capability data or an observed server limit still uses the 200k fallback. ([#2038](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2038))

Both carry their published prices (Sol \$2/\$10 per 1M tokens with \$0.20 cache reads, Luna \$0.10/\$0.50 with \$0.01 cache reads, both doubling input and 1.5x output past 272k), 128k output, text and image input, tool search and additional-tools support, and the documented effort ladder `none`/`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`. Project prompt budgets: Luna ships the full 922k input cap, Sol ships 400k, on every provider that lists the model.

- OpenRouter's passthrough rows for `openai/gpt-6-sol` and `openai/gpt-6-luna` (and their `-pro` / `:batch` siblings) shipped in 2026.9.22-4 with no effort ladder at all, so `xhigh` and `max` were not selectable there and the rows sat at the raw 922k window instead of the tier budget. They now carry the same GPT-6 ladder and budget as the first-party rows.

- Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`, released 2026-09-22) joins the catalog on Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock (global/us/eu/jp/au inference profiles), OpenRouter and Vercel AI Gateway: 1M context, 128k output, \$4/\$20 per 1M tokens with \$0.20 cache reads, `xhigh` and `max` effort, and `claude-opus-5` as its server-side refusal fallback.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Claude Opus 5.5 is usable on the release that first exposed it. 2026.9.22-3 shipped a partial catalog row for `claude-opus-5-5`, so selecting the model and turning thinking off sent `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` and the request failed with a 400; per-message effort and the server-side refusal fallback were missing too, Amazon Bedrock listed the bare `anthropic.claude-opus-5-5` id that is reachable only through an inference profile, and no prompt preset matched the model, so it ran on the generic system prompt. The row now carries the full set, Bedrock lists only the five profiles, and the model has its own preset.

- Requests to Claude Opus 5.5 never carry `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` or a forced `tool_choice` (`any` / a named tool). Opus 5.5 rejects both with a 400 where Opus 5 accepted them, so a thinking-off turn now pins effort `low` and a forced-tool turn sends `tool_choice` omitted, on the Anthropic Messages and Bedrock providers alike, including gateway rows that carry no catalog metadata.

- Internal module and symbol names now follow the subscription provider rename: `openai-codex.ts` -> `chatgpt-subscription.ts` (provider, OAuth flow and auth utils), `openaiCodexOAuth` -> `chatgptSubscriptionOAuth`, and the rest of the identifier family likewise; the model-data shard and manifest entry renamed with them. The wire api id `openai-codex-responses`, its adapter files and every persisted token are unchanged. ([#1989](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1989))

- Pooled-credential slot repair keeps recognizing the managed sentinel after the `claude-sdk-oauth` -> `anthropic-subscription` provider rename: matchers accept both `anthropic-subscription-managed` and the legacy `claude-sdk-oauth-managed` material that existing stored credentials carry verbatim.

Both are reachable on their direct provider shards as well as the aggregator mirrors that already serve them (GitHub Copilot, OpenRouter, Venice, Vercel AI Gateway, opencode-go, Xiaomi token plans). Grok 4.5/4.6 also pick up the context-tier pricing models.dev already publishes for them, now that the xAI generator path keeps tiered costs instead of flattening them. ([#1990](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1990))

### Changed

- The OpenAI subscription provider is now `chatgpt-subscription`, shown as **ChatGPT Subscription**, instead of `openai-codex` / "OpenAI Codex" — the id named a CLI, not the thing you are signing in with. Its wire dialect id `openai-codex-responses` is unchanged, so no request shape moves. ([#1989](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1989))

### Fixed

- OpenAI hard-quota exhaustion (`usage_limit_reached`, `usage_not_included`) is terminal on the first failure instead of retrying a dead account five more times, and a failure carrying either provider code is terminal even when the message text is opaque. Approaching-the-limit warnings stay retryable. ([#1969](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1969))

Credentials saved before this release keep today's behaviour: `KIMI_CODE_OAUTH_HOST` / `KIMI_OAUTH_HOST`, then kimi.com. ([#1890](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1890))

The shared `check` script used to rewrite it in place; once that autofix was removed, the release job became the first thing to regenerate the catalog under the strict gate and stopped there. The generator now formats the file before reporting success. ([#1886](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1886))

- `describeProviderStallForUser(errorMessage, options)` (`utils/retry.ts`, exported from the package root): turns a provider stream-stall watchdog message (stream-start, idle, WebSocket liveness or Responses completion) into one plain-language sentence naming the model, the stalled phase and the bound, optionally with the same-model attempts spent and the next step to take. Returns `undefined` for anything that is not a stall, so callers keep their verbatim error ([#1740](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1740)).

- `EMPTY_RESPONSE_ERROR`, `EMPTY_TOOL_USE_ERROR`, `FORWARDED_EMPTY_RESPONSE_ERROR` and `FORWARDED_EMPTY_TOOL_USE_ERROR` (`utils/empty-response-errors.ts`, exported from the package root): the terminal error texts the pi-agent-core empty-assistant recovery wrapper produces, so the wrapper and the retry classifier share one definition ([#1733](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1733)).

- OpenAI Responses streams (SSE and WebSocket, every provider that shares the Responses processor) now treat silence after the last output item as a stall: once every `response.output_item.done` has arrived and no new item was added, `response.completed` must follow within 60 s or the turn fails as `Provider stream stalled after the last output item: response.completed timed out after 60000ms` and takes the same-model retry, instead of waiting out the 300 s idle watchdog; open items and pre-first-item silence keep the idle watchdog alone, so long reasoning is never cut ([#1648](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1648)).
- OpenAI Codex and OpenAI Responses WebSocket streams now run a ping/pong liveness heartbeat (ping after 30 s of silence, dead after two unanswered pings), so a half-open connection fails as a provider stall in about 70 s and takes the same-model retry instead of freezing the turn for the full 300 s watchdog; on Bun a parked Codex WebSocket that the server closed is no longer reused (the proxy-aware wrapper now exposes `readyState`, and parked sockets evict themselves on `close`/`error`), which was the deterministic five-minute stall reported on gpt-5.6-sol ([#1648](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1648)).

- Fixed OpenRouter Anthropic Messages requests to send `x-session-id` from `sessionId` when prompt caching is enabled, matching the header Chat Completions models already sent ([#9102](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9102)).

- Cursor model windows now follow the ceiling the server reports. Every conversation checkpoint carries `tokenDetails.maxTokens`, and that observation is recorded per model id, persisted beside the conversation rotation store and preferred over the committed capability table, so a family whose real window is smaller than the table claims no longer sizes requests against a window it does not have ([#1603](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1603)).

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Pooled OAuth credential slots now retain optional human-readable display names while preserving immutable slot identities for selection, affinity, refresh, and failover.
- Added the Devin (Cognition) Cascade transport: `devin-agent` Connect/protobuf streaming is mapped natively onto the shared stream contract, so text, thinking, tool calls, usage and stop reasons arrive as ordinary events, a failed or content-filtered stop is surfaced as an error instead of a silent end, and a truncated turn keeps the `length` stop reason. Model discovery is authenticated with the stored credential and falls back to the bundled SWE seed when the discovery endpoint is unavailable, so an offline or rate-limited discovery never empties the model list ([#1604](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1604)).
- Added Devin (Cognition) CLI OAuth: the authorization flow is PKCE S256 with a loopback callback on `127.0.0.1:59653` and the state validated before the code is spent, and the issued CLI token is stored with the expiry derived from its own JWT rather than an assumed lifetime ([#1601](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1601)).

### Changed

### Fixed
- A provider-owned OAuth account pool is merged onto the stored pool at commit time instead of overwriting it with the pre-login snapshot, so a sibling account that rotated its refresh token or earned a rate-limit block during an interactive login is never rewound; pool slots carrying the provider's managed sentinel marker are recognized and dropped so they can never dead-end a request.
- The auth-miss wording `Provider is not configured: <id>` is now a shared exported helper used by every throw site, so consumers keying recovery decisions off it cannot drift from the generators.
- Claude Agent SDK `Lock file is already being held` is classified as a transient retryable error instead of an unknown/terminal failure.

- Kimi For Coding sessions now identify themselves as a Kimi client. `api.kimi.com/coding` recognizes its clients by a product `User-Agent` plus a six-header `X-Msh-*` device set (platform, version, device name, device model, OS version, per-install device id), which the official Kimi Code client sends on device authorization, token poll, token refresh, and every managed request; senpi sent none of them, so a subscription session presented itself as an anonymous Anthropic-protocol client holding a Kimi bearer token. The OAuth subscription path now sends the full set on all four request paths. Header values are printable-ASCII sanitized (the endpoint answers 520 on raw non-ASCII bytes) and the device id persists under the agent dir, falling back to a per-process id when that directory is unwritable instead of throwing. The api-key path is unchanged and stays header-free, because it authenticates with a platform key rather than a client session ([#1504](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1504))

- Venice AI is a built-in provider: id `venice`, `VENICE_API_KEY`, base URL `https://api.venice.ai/api/v1`, and a 104-model OpenAI-compatible catalog generated from models.dev whose ids were all confirmed against Venice's live `/models` listing. Venice's `ChatCompletionRequest` schema is `additionalProperties: false`, so a new `veniceParameters` compat flag shapes the one Venice-only request field: the catalog sets `venice_parameters: { include_venice_system_prompt: false }`, without which Venice prepends its own default system prompt ahead of the caller's ([#1551](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1551))

- OpenAI images: `background`, `outputFormat`, `outputCompression`, `moderation`, and `mask` options reach the wire as `background`, `output_format`, `output_compression`, `moderation`, and a `mask` upload; transparent-with-jpeg, compression-with-png, out-of-range compression, and mask-without-image are rejected before any request. Responses report `background`, returned bytes are labeled by their magic (falling back to the requested format), image input tokens are priced with the new optional `ImagesModel.cost.imageInput` rate ($8/M for GPT Image 2 and 2.5), and `KnownImagesProvider` includes `openai`. `parseOpenAIImageOutputOptions` and the option types are exported through the compat surface.

### Changed

### Fixed

- OAuth token refresh no longer holds the credential store lock across the network: `Models.getAuth()` runs the provider's token exchange outside `CredentialStore.modify`, then re-enters the store and writes only if the slot's refresh token is unchanged (a slot rotated meanwhile by another process is adopted instead of overwritten). Concurrent requests for one slot join a single exchange, and a `Models.refresh()`/`setProvider()` for the same provider joins an in-flight token refresh instead of aborting it through the per-provider catalog-refresh controller ([#1542](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1542)).

- Anthropic prompt caching no longer breaks on every tool continuation: when the model answers a tool call without a thinking block (the normal adaptive-thinking outcome), the follow-up request keeps the same `thinking`/`output_config` instead of degrading to disabled thinking, so the cached prefix is read instead of re-written ("cache misses every second prompt"). Only a budget-thinking request replaying a tool turn produced by another API still degrades, the case Anthropic has rejected.

- Anthropic OAuth login no longer dead-ends on a browser page reading "State mismatch." when another senpi/omo process on the same machine still holds the callback port 53692: the login binds an ephemeral loopback port instead and carries that port through the auth URL and the token exchange. A callback that belongs to another login now explains that the login belongs to a different session and how to continue, and a login that gets neither a browser callback nor a pasted redirect URL for 10 minutes times out and releases its port instead of holding it indefinitely.

- Anthropic mid-output server fallback now follows the configured abort/continue policy instead of raising an unsupported-fallback error. Continuing responses retain their serving-model identity and do not execute abandoned pre-fallback tools, including through text-tool recovery middleware.

- `streamSimple` on the OpenAI Responses and Codex Responses adapters forwards the new `SimpleStreamOptions.serviceTier` into the request (`service_tier`) and tier-aware usage pricing; the simple path previously dropped it (code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent#6795).

- Fixed fragmented Mistral tool calls splitting when continuation chunks omit the tool-call ID ([#8387](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/8387)).
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible reasoning replay to merge consecutive streamed text and summary `reasoning_details` deltas.
- Fixed the Cloudflare AI Gateway catalog to include supported `workers-ai/*` passthrough models omitted by models.dev.
- Fixed OpenRouter reasoning controls by deriving `off` support and available effort levels from OpenRouter's model metadata, preventing reasoning-mandatory models from receiving `effort: "none"` ([#8614](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/8614) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

- New shared helper `dropFailedAssistantTurns` (exported from the package barrel) removes assistant turns with `stopReason` `error` or `aborted` from a converted LLM message list, together with every tool result whose `toolCallId` was declared only by those dropped assistants; a call id re-declared by a kept assistant keeps its result, mirroring the provider-layer `droppedCallIds` pairing in `transform-messages.ts`. Order and every other message are preserved. Consumed by both `convertToLlm` implementations (coding-agent core and agent harness) so every LLM request built from converted context excludes failed provider turns.

- Provider requests are no longer sent with `max_tokens` shrunk to a handful of tokens (down to 1) once the estimated context fills the model window. `buildBaseOptions` now throws `ContextWindowExhaustedError` when fewer than 1024 tokens of answer room remain after the safety margin (windows under 5120 tokens cannot hold that geometry and keep the previous behavior); the lazy API boundary surfaces it as an assistant error ("Context window exhausted: the conversation is estimated at X of Y tokens, leaving fewer than 1024 tokens for a response. Compact the conversation, enable auto-compaction, or start a new session before retrying.") that `isContextOverflow` classifies as a context overflow, so auto-compaction can recover when it is enabled and the user sees the real cause when it is not. Previously such requests returned truncated tool calls ("Tool call stream ended before completion") or a one-token "length" stop while billing the whole prompt.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Adding a second account to a provider whose stored credential predates credential pools (a flat entry with no `accounts` array, which is what `openai-codex` OAuth login writes) no longer overwrites the first one. `appendLoginSlot` now promotes that legacy credential into the pool as the `default` slot and stores the new login beside it as `login-2`, so both accounts remain usable and the flat top-level fields still authenticate a build predating pools. First login (no stored credential) still writes the flat credential as-is, and a provider that returns its own populated `accounts` array is still written through untouched.
- Removing the account whose material the flat top-level credential fields projected no longer leaves the pool authenticating as the deleted account. `removeSlot` now re-projects those fields from the first surviving slot, so a pool left with a single account (which does not enter credential rotation and therefore resolves through the flat projection) immediately uses the account that remains. `accounts` is kept, removing a non-projected slot still leaves the flat fields untouched, and removing the last slot still drops the credential entirely.

The same strict regeneration carries current upstream drift (nvidia retires nemotron-3-nano, openrouter adds mercury-2.5-preview and retires three opus `-fast` variants, vercel retires deepseek-v3).

### Changed

- OpenGateway `moonshotai/kimi-k3-ultrafast` now registers a 256k (262144) default context window instead of inheriting the base model's full 1M window, so sessions compact at the serving default; the strict model-data regeneration also carries current upstream catalog drift (opengateway, openrouter, google, groq, vercel-ai-gateway).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Cursor conversation caches no longer grow for process lifetime: entries are dropped when their session's resources are cleaned up, the pre-rotation key is deleted when a poisoned conversation rotates to a fresh wire id, rotation records are count-bounded, and defensive byte/count bounds cap the state and blob stores for sessions that never dispose.

- Cursor conversation cache eviction can no longer break a live request: blobs the in-flight request references are pinned for the duration of its stream (the byte cap evicts only unpinned blobs and reads promote recency, so the server's mid-turn `getBlobArgs` always resolves), the conversation count cap is enforced per owning session instead of across the process (one session's churn can no longer forget another session's conversation) and never evicts a conversation with a request in flight, and a new process-global blob ceiling (`PI_CURSOR_CONVERSATION_TOTAL_BLOB_LIMIT_BYTES`, default 1 GiB) bounds all cached conversations together, shedding cold conversations first.

- The Anthropic unsigned-thinking replay fallback capability is forgotten when its session's resources are cleaned up, so long-lived multi-session hosts stop collecting one entry per (session, model) that ever hit the invalid-signature retry.

- The OpenAI Responses session websocket idle expiry re-arms itself when it fires while a socket is busy, and drops a busy entry whose socket already died, so a lost release can no longer pin a cached websocket forever.

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Credential pool engine under `@earendil-works/pi-ai/auth/pool/*`: HRW slot selection with an injected hasher (`select`), a three-way in-lane failure taxonomy (`classify`), and a slot failover runner (`failover`) that rotates accounts only before committed output and marks post-output failures with the turn-retry suppression prefix.
- `AuthResolutionOverrides.slotName` resolves provider auth against one named credential slot, refreshing exactly that slot under the store lock while siblings and the flat downgrade projection stay untouched.

- Credential pool slot algebra under `@earendil-works/pi-ai/auth/pool/slots`: a stored credential can hold sibling slots, and `listSlots` / `upsertSlot` / `removeSlot` / `pinSlot` define slot-preserving mutation. A credential without an `accounts` array reads as a one-slot pool with no write-back, and a pooled entry keeps its flat top-level credential so older builds keep authenticating.

- Cursor Composer models receive an operating prefix as their own leading system blob, carrying this client's native tool vocabulary and completion rules in place of the Cursor-harness habits they were trained on. Other Cursor models keep their existing request shape.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Kimi XTML channel markers no longer reach user-visible assistant text when a leaked marker arrives without its trailing `<|sep|>` (seen live as a text block ending in the literal `<|close|>think` newline). One shared channel-marker grammar now backs both the stream recovery parser and message-level thinking recovery, which also strips markers from `text` blocks while keeping code-span literals intact ([#1092](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1092)).

- Cursor streams no longer fail while the server keeps sending heartbeats or checkpoints: the provider now matches the official Cursor CLI's stream recovery, refreshing its 30s health deadline on every inbound frame and silently retrying pre-`turnEnded` stalls or transport deaths with bounded backoff, resuming from the latest conversation checkpoint with the originally pinned model. Long-running local tools and long `xhigh` thinking turns previously died with `Cursor stream ended before turnEnded: inbound stream stalled` and immediately rotated the fallback chain.

- Refreshed dependency pins (`@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime`, `@google/genai`, `@smithy/node-http-handler`, `typebox`) and removed the unused `chalk`, `proxy-from-env`, and `@mistralai/mistralai` dependencies.

- Skip ANTML invoke recovery when `model.api === "cursor-agent"` so native Cursor tool starts are not rejected as invalid event order ([#1013](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1013) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Cursor MCP `task` complete no longer overwrites streamed arguments with `{}`; the last usable task args are kept ([#1017](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1017) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Cursor conversation-id rotation now persists under the agent directory (`CODING_AGENT_DIR` or `~/.senpi/agent`) instead of `$HOME/cursor-conversation-ids.json`, so a reminted wire id survives TUI restart ([#998](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/998) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Cursor 0-token `resource_exhausted` surfaces on the first failure of a `stream()` call so the session layer can compact before any conversation-id rotation; rotation and same-stream retry apply only to later attempts ([#998](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/998) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- After Cursor conversation-id rotation is skipped at the 3-rotation cap, the next `stream()` remints a fresh wire id instead of failing the session with a poisoned-conversation error, and only the dead conversation is abandoned ([#998](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/998) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Cursor 0-token `resource_exhausted` is treated as overflow without a local-estimate floor, and Cursor overflow compaction keeps no recent-token tail so the retry payload actually shrinks ([#1015](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1015) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).
- Cursor billed `cacheRead` that dwarfs the live conversation window is ignored: checkpoint `usedTokens` is treated as the real context size when dashboard-cumulative `cache_read_tokens` is more than 3× that window, so compaction is not fired against a multi-million cache-read figure ([#985](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/985) by [@leeseunguk](https://github.com/leeseunguk)).

- Explicit Cursor thinking levels no longer die with `Connect error not_found`: Cursor's Run RPC
  rejects bare capability ids (`kimi-k3`, `claude-fable-5`, …) with `not_found`, so
  `resolveCursorSelectionDescriptor` now prefers the catalog-guaranteed suffix variant id
  (`kimi-k3-high`, `claude-fable-5-thinking-low`) whenever a legacy alias exists, keeping bare
  base id + ordered parameters only as the fallback for alias-less levels (#1008).

- Upstream sync (`badlogic/pi-mono` main@`59a71b23`): adopted generalized thinking-token-budget fields (`thinkingTokenBudgetField`, `supportsThinkingTokenBudget`), Google thinking-level maps, Bedrock response smithy headers, Azure Responses tool-choice forwarding, and the simple tool-choice option. Fork pins (`openai@6.26.0`), Kimi top-level cached-token parsing, `-fast` priority-tier emission, and fork-only providers/catalog overlays are unchanged.
- xAI now routes through the Responses API with Grok 4.6 as the provider default, matching upstream; fork xAI model specs are preserved.
- Model catalog refreshed with upstream provider updates: Z.AI Chinese Coding Plan entries, Qwen Token Plan DeepSeek V4 Pro, Baseten GLM input modalities, and OpenRouter additions.

### Fixed

- Native Cursor turns now report real usage: the billed token split on `turnEnded`
  (input/output/cache read/cache write, taken from the production cursor-agent schema) lands on
  `usage`, and conversation checkpoints feed the server's live `usedTokens` into the in-flight
  message so context accounting and the TUI meter move mid-turn instead of showing output-only
  counts until turn end.

- `resource_exhausted` errors that arrive after tokens already streamed are classified as context
  overflow (compact-and-retry) instead of rate limit; zero-token `resource_exhausted` rejections
  keep the rate-limit path so poisoned-conversation rotation still applies.

### Removed
- Deprecated Xiaomi models dropped, and the unused `@opentelemetry/api` dependency removed from `packages/ai` (no source imports it).

## [2026.8.18-3] - 2026-08-18

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Cursor context windows now track the models.dev first-party catalog capped by the context options
  Cursor offers each family: current Claude families and GPT 5.5/5.6 report 1M, Grok 500K, Gemini Flash
  1048576, and each request asks Cursor for the matching `context` token.

- Cursor reasoning levels: the dynamic Cursor catalog now collapses the 204 account variant ids into
  selectable base identities (Claude `base` / `base-thinking` boolean identities) with exact
  `thinkingLevelMap` ladders, live-catalog context windows (Kimi K3 1048576, GLM 5.2 1M, GPT 272K,
  Grok 256K, Claude 1M-label families 300K), and a shared cursor capability table derived from the
  2026-08-18 AvailableModels capture; explicit thinking selections render into the protobuf
  `RequestedModel.parameters` (per-family `thinking`/`context`/`effort`/`reasoning`/`fast` templates,
  GPT 5.5 / Codex 5.3 `xhigh` → `extra-high`), absent selections keep the representative variant
  request shape, and stored 204-variant catalogs migrate idempotently through the new
  `restoreModels` provider hook. Adds `ThinkingSelection` provenance propagation through agent
  state, loop turn updates, and the remote proxy.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Cursor provider: advertised MCP tool schemas are now sanitized of JSON-Schema composition
  keywords (`oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`) before reaching the Run request — a single tool carrying one
  (e.g. ast-grep MCP's `scan`) made Cursor's gateway reject the whole request with a wrapped
  provider 400 (`resource_exhausted`, zero tokens) from turn 1.
- Leaked-invoke recovery now resolves upstream wire-aliased tool names (ccapi
  PascalCase disguises like `TaskSend`, CC-pool hashed prefixes like
  `mcp_49f0-Todo`, CC-SDK `mcp__server__tool` forms), so a text-leaked
  `<invoke name="mcp_49f0-Todo">` recovers into the registered `todo` tool
  call instead of rendering as literal text. Alias collisions between
  registered tools stay literal text.

  ChatGPT OAuth (`openai-codex`) catalogs ([#933](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/933)).
- Refreshed Vercel AI Gateway pricing for `alibaba/qwen3.8-27b` from zero-value placeholder metadata to the

  non-reasoning variants with their correct fixed-thinking behavior ([#930](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/930)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.17] - 2026-08-17

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- `openai-codex` provider now ships `-fast` Priority-tier variants for GPT-5.6 sol/terra/luna, mirroring the existing `openai` provider pattern (`upstreamModelId` + `serviceTier: "priority"`, base cost rates). The Codex Responses adapter already supports Priority service tier and applies the cost multiplier at usage-accounting time, so catalog costs stay at base values to avoid double-counting.
- Cursor chat and tool calling are now fully supported through the new `cursor-agent` API: one HTTP/2 Connect stream per assistant turn against `agent.v1.AgentService/Run`, streaming text/thinking/tool-call deltas, usage from token deltas, and in-band execution of Cursor's server-driven exec channel (native read/ls/grep/write/shell frames, modern `pi_*` frames, MCP-advertised tools, kv blob store, tool-catalog handshake). Bridged tool runs are synthesized into the assistant message as already-resolved tool calls with paired results, so transcripts and the agent loop stay consistent, and the model catalog is discovered per account through `GetUsableModels` after `/login cursor` (max-mode 1M-context variants included). The Cursor protobuf schema is vendored with a regeneration script; unsupported protocol surfaces (computer use, subagents, background shells, canvas, smart-mode classification, conversation search) answer with typed refusals ([#910](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/910)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Cloudflare AI Gateway live tests now pin `claude-sonnet-5` instead of the retired `claude-sonnet-4-5` id, so root typecheck still passes after model-catalog hydration ([#925](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/925)).
- Cursor's server-driven exec channel now keeps pending local tools alive with write-completion-chained 3-second
  exec heartbeats and closes every normal typed result sequence exactly once. Read, shell, MCP, and modern `pi_*`
  tool turns no longer leave the server-side exec pending until the Run stream ends before `turnEnded`
  ([#915](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/915)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.16] - 2026-08-16

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Cursor (Pro/Ultra/Teams) is now a builtin OAuth provider: `/login cursor` opens the `cursor.com/loginDeepControl` browser deep link with a PKCE S256 challenge and polls `api2.cursor.sh/auth/poll` with capped backoff until the browser approval releases the tokens; refresh exchanges the stored refresh token at `auth/exchange_user_api_key` under the credential-store lock and keeps the previous refresh token when Cursor does not rotate it. Definitive poll rejections (400/401/403/410) fail fast instead of being retried as network hiccups, the poll wait is abort-aware, and token expiry derives from the access-token JWT `exp` claim with a 5-minute refresh skew. The provider is authentication-only for now — Cursor chat runs on a protobuf Connect-RPC agent protocol that is not ported yet, so no models are exposed; the stored access token resolves through the standard auth pipeline for integrations that speak the Cursor protocol ([#905](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/905)).
- GLM 5.3 is now a fully supported model family: 25 catalog entries cloned across 18 providers (alibaba-token-plan, baseten, cloudflare, fireworks, huggingface, nvidia, opencode, opencode-go, opengateway, openrouter, qwen-token-plan, together, vercel-ai-gateway, zai, zai-coding-cn), the `openai-completions` thinking-level-map matcher generalizes to cover 5.3 (`isGlm52` → `isGlm5x`), and the zai `thinkingFormat` handler forces `{type:"enabled"}` for 5.3 even when no reasoning effort is set (5.3 cannot disable thinking per the Z.AI wire contract). `generate-models.ts` was updated so regeneration preserves the 5.3 entries and their thinkingLevelMaps ([#895](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/895)).

### Changed

- Synced the provider transports with upstream v0.84.2: the Anthropic streaming path now uses upstream's SSE decoder with deferred tools (`tool_reference`/`defer_loading`) and adaptive `xhigh` effort, OpenAI Completions gained strict JSON-schema conversion, grammar/custom tool calls and the new thinking backends, and the Responses transports support upstream's `additional_tools` deferred-tool mode. The fork's server-fallback receipts, retry hints, tool-choice fallback, prompt-cache TTL, deterministic tool-call-ID sanitizer and `senpi` wire identity are preserved. `mistral-conversations` moves to upstream's native transport. Provider catalog data was refreshed for the capabilities these features read (`supportsAdditionalTools`, native DeepSeek `max_tokens`, Cloudflare Responses strict mode, DeepSeek V4 Flash `low` effort), and DeepSeek base-URL detection is now case-insensitive ([#892](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/892)).

### Fixed

- Stored OAuth request resolution now refreshes before availability checks, passes transient request environment through both availability and auth derivation, preserves it for replay, and respects explicit empty environment overrides ([#836](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/836) by [@ismetanin](https://github.com/ismetanin)).
- Ambient-only API-key compatibility adapters can no longer outrank a valid stored OAuth credential ([#836](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/836) by [@ismetanin](https://github.com/ismetanin)).
- Ambient-only authentication can now apply provider-owned request credential namespaces without importing sibling host credentials ([#836](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/836) by [@ismetanin](https://github.com/ismetanin)).
- `isContextOverflow` now classifies gateway HTTP 413 byte-size rejections — "Request body too large", "Request Entity Too Large", `body_too_large`, and "Payload Too Large" — as overflow, the same recovery class as Anthropic's native `request_too_large`. Sessions whose requests exceed a gateway body limit previously saw these as terminal errors, which wedged compaction on every fallback model ([#884](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/884)).

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed the exported `ModelsStreamTransforms` interface to `ModelsRequestTransforms` because its header transformation now applies to all authenticated provider requests.
- Required dynamic model providers to accept a concrete `RefreshModelsContext.signal`; `Models.refresh()` remains unbounded when callers omit its optional signal.
- Required provider login, API-key check/resolution, and OAuth refresh implementations to accept a concrete abort signal; public auth and credential operations remain unbounded when callers omit their optional signal.
- Replaced raw `RefreshModelsContext.store` access with the read-only `context.stored` snapshot and generation-checked `context.publish()` transaction. `createProvider({ fetchModels })` needs no catalog-publication migration; handwritten `Provider.refreshModels()` implementations must publish restored and refreshed catalogs through `context.publish()`, passing `persist` to write (`ModelsStoreEntry`) or delete (`null`) storage and `update` for the in-memory publication.

### Added

- Added Qwen Token Plan Individual as a built-in provider with its documented subscription model catalog and the shared international `QWEN_TOKEN_PLAN_API_KEY` ([#7659](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7659) by [@arasovic](https://github.com/arasovic)).
- Added Baseten as a built-in OpenAI-compatible provider with models.dev catalog generation and native `chat_template_args` reasoning controls.
- Added optional `OAuthAuth.isSubscription` metadata for distinguishing subscription-backed authentication from generic OAuth sign-in.
- Added explicit `TelemetryContext` propagation across stream, deferred, and image request options using the vendor-neutral `@earendil-works/pi-telemetry` contract.
- Added deferred provider request contracts, durable response handles, authenticated fetch/cancel dispatch, and faux-provider support for pending, ready, failed, and cancelled responses ([#7339](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7339) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Added arbitrary OpenAI-compatible sampling parameters through `Model.samplingParams` and `StreamOptions.samplingParams`, including per-request overrides ([#7568](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7568) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia)).
- Added opt-in vLLM `thinking_token_budget` support for OpenAI-compatible models, reserving output tokens for the final answer ([#7638](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7638) by [@bnsd55](https://github.com/bnsd55)).
- Added `OpenAICompletionsCompat.supportsFinishReason` for providers that omit streamed `finish_reason` values, inferring normal and tool-use stops when the stream ends.
- Added structured Amazon Bedrock failure diagnostics with HTTP status, modeled error code, and AWS request id when available ([#7286](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7286) by [@brianstanley](https://github.com/brianstanley)).
- Added `ModelsStoreEntry.etag` so persisted provider catalogs can carry the remote ETag validator for conditional refreshes.
- Added `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` bearer authentication for Anthropic-compatible gateways ([#5871](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5871)).
- Added Claude Opus 5 support for Anthropic and Amazon Bedrock with adaptive thinking, inference profiles, prompt caching, and preserved AWS validation messages ([#7081](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7081) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge), [#7083](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7083) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Added manual redirect URL and authorization-code entry to OpenRouter OAuth login for remote and headless environments ([#7114](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7114) by [@rgarcia](https://github.com/rgarcia)).

### Changed

- Added optional cancellation to `ModelsStore` reads, writes, and deletions; catalog orchestration binds these waits to the provider refresh signal.
- Changed Radius OAuth device authorization, token exchange, and refresh requests to use the configured gateway directly.
- Changed `ModelsError` messages to append the underlying cause, so auth failures such as `OAuth refresh failed for openai-codex` report the provider response instead of a bare wrapper message.

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot Grok 4.5 requests to use the supported Responses API ([#7560](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7560)).
- Bounded OAuth token refreshes so stalled requests release the credential-store lock ([#7508](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7508)).
- Fixed tool argument validation to preserve values that already match an `anyOf`/`oneOf` union arm before attempting coercion, avoiding nullable unions converting `null` to another primitive value ([#7328](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7328)).
- Fixed cancellation of model catalog refreshes so callers stop waiting even when a custom provider ignores its abort signal ([#7027](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7027)).
- Fixed auth resolution, availability checks, OAuth refreshes, provider login, and in-memory credential queue waits to honor caller cancellation.
- Fixed newer provider refreshes being blocked by or overwritten by an older stalled generation, including persisted catalog publication.
- Fixed Fireworks GLM 5.2 models sending the unsupported `prompt_cache_retention` field when long cache retention is enabled, and enabled session affinity for automatic prompt caching ([#7676](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7676)).
- Fixed the OpenCode Go provider display name.
- Fixed provider error normalization treating arrays and class instances as structured response bodies instead of preserving their original errors ([#7205](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7205) by [@erikogenvik](https://github.com/erikogenvik)).
- Fixed Anthropic streams dropping text or thinking included in the initial content-block event ([#7358](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7358) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed Google history conversion dropping signed empty text and thinking blocks required for replay ([#7362](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7362) by [@jingtao-wisdomgraph](https://github.com/jingtao-wisdomgraph)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex cached WebSocket sessions being shared across different account credentials ([#7364](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7364)).
- Fixed transient Google Generative AI and Vertex AI provider errors bypassing automatic retries ([#7471](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7471) by [@vish-pr](https://github.com/vish-pr)).
- Fixed Gemini 3 tool call ids being discarded during history conversion, breaking signed multi-turn replay ([#7494](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7494) by [@muyiyr](https://github.com/muyiyr)).
- Fixed OpenAI Responses incomplete reasons so only `max_output_tokens` is treated as a length stop, and exposed bounded recovery detection for responses truncated below their intended output limit ([#7540](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7540) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Restored GitHub Copilot models returned through account-specific policy responses ([#7672](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7672) by [@muyiyr](https://github.com/muyiyr)).
- Replaced the retired Qwen Token Plan `qwen3.8-max-preview` model with `qwen3.8-max` ([#7670](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7670) by [@QuintinShaw](https://github.com/QuintinShaw)).
- Fixed Z.AI providers and compatible custom endpoints to send output limits through `max_tokens`, which those endpoints honor ([#7174](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7174) by [@HyeokjaeLee](https://github.com/HyeokjaeLee)).
- Fixed explicitly configured Amazon Bedrock profiles being overridden by ambient AWS access keys ([#7176](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7176) by [@christianbasch](https://github.com/christianbasch)).
- Fixed malformed OpenAI-compatible tool-call deltas with both a valid `function` payload and an empty `custom` object discarding the function arguments ([#7288](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7288) by [@sunnyyoung](https://github.com/sunnyyoung)).

- Made `optional` keyword stripping in `google-shared.ts` schema-position-aware:
  `stripOptional()` now preserves legitimate properties named `optional` under
  `properties`/`patternProperties`/`$defs`/`definitions` and passes through value
  keywords (`const`/`default`/`examples`/`enum`) without traversing them.
  `sanitizeForOpenApi()` now recurses into array branches so `optional` inside
  `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf` is stripped on the legacy Gemini `parameters` path.

- Added the OpenGateway built-in provider for the OpenAI-compatible gateway at `https://apis.opengateway.ai`: a generated 62-model catalog hydrated from the live `/v1/models` endpoint (chat-capable, non-retired models enriched with models.dev pricing/context/reasoning metadata), `OPENGATEWAY_API_KEY` env detection, and `supportsDeveloperRole: false` compat because the gateway rejects the OpenAI `developer` role.

  conversation switches to an Anthropic-backed gateway ([#810](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/810)).
- Gateway/provider failures reported as `The model request was rejected. Check the request and try again.` now go
  through the configured bounded retry policy instead of failing immediately or burning the fallback chain
  ([#806](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/806)).
- `OAuthAuth` accepts an optional availability `check` that `checkProviderAuth` consults in the stored-OAuth
  branch, so a provider whose stored credential does not by itself imply usability (for example a zero-account
  sentinel) is no longer reported as configured. When `check` is absent, behavior is unchanged
  ([#804](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/804)).
- Provider-specific OAuth availability checks can now reject empty sentinel credentials and recognize usable ambient
  auth without refreshing or exposing tokens ([#803](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/803)).

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added a native Anthropic `warmPromptCache` primitive for zero-output prompt-cache pre-warming with normalized cache usage accounting.
- Added `prompt_cache_key` support for Moonshot/Kimi Chat Completions and first-request OpenRouter affinity through
  both `x-session-id` and the request body's `session_id`.

### Changed

- Expanded explicit OpenRouter prompt-cache markers to Anthropic, Qwen, and Google model prefixes, including
  catalog model IDs with one leading `~`.

### Fixed

- Fixed Kimi cache-read accounting for flat `usage.cached_tokens` responses.
- Restricted Bedrock one-hour prompt-cache TTLs to Claude Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, and Haiku 4.5; other cacheable
  Bedrock Claude models now consistently use the five-minute wire and resolver TTL.
- Reported the Claude SDK OAuth lane's SDK-managed prompt-cache TTL as five minutes.
- Fixed `warmPromptCache` eagerly loading the Anthropic SDK and message implementation for models that cannot use
  Anthropic prompt-cache warming. Capability checks now run first, so unsupported provider lanes avoid the optional
  Anthropic dependency entirely while supported models preserve the same pre-warm request and usage accounting.

- Recovered Claude tool calls that omit the opening `<` before a lowercase
  `antml:invoke` and append a stray `</function_results>` trailer, dispatching
  the validated tool call instead of exposing internal protocol markup.

- Fixed OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions tool schemas whose object-shaped root used `anyOf`, `oneOf`, or `allOf`:
  root object typing is no longer hoisted away, and object-shaped root `anyOf`/`oneOf` schemas now retain root
  properties and required names while merging branch properties. The same object-root normalization is used for
  Moonshot, while scalar and mixed root unions are left unchanged rather than being mislabeled as objects
  ([#718](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/718)).
- Fixed Anthropic tool conversion advertising object-shaped root `anyOf`/`oneOf` schemas as parameterless tools.
  The adapter now resolves those schemas into top-level properties and required names before constructing
  `input_schema`, while leaving ordinary object schemas unchanged
  ([#718](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/718)).
- Stopped same-model retries for recognized malformed `tools.`/`functions.` schema errors, including
  gateway-wrapped 5xx responses and `invalid tool schema` messages. These matches are classified non-retryable before
  generic server-error rules; unrelated transient 5xx failures remain retryable
  ([#718](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/718)).

  `reasoning_effort` compatibility (`off` to `none`, thinking mode to `default`), the typed request regression
  follows the replacement catalog ID, and reviewed provider snapshots are refreshed so live generation no longer
  breaks root TypeScript validation before a release can be committed

- Enforced final Anthropic tool-use/tool-result pairing after pruning, interruption, or model switching ([#641](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/641)).
- Restored non-429 `retry-after` handling displaced during the hint-aware 429 retry migration ([#657](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/657)).
- Updated GPT-5.6 Terra and Luna pricing across OpenAI and passthrough model catalogs.
- Fixed Fireworks Kimi K3 models to use the OpenAI-compatible API with native reasoning-effort levels and deferred tools ([#7199](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7199), [#7230](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7230) by [@XBeg9](https://github.com/XBeg9)).

### Removed

## [2026.8.1] - 2026-08-01

### Breaking Changes

### Changed

- Refresh generated provider catalogs from their live sources. OpenRouter now
  removes 29 no-longer-advertised `:batch` variants plus retired
  `mistralai/devstral-2512` and `openai/gpt-5.1-chat`, and adds
  `thinkingmachines/inkling-small`; Vercel AI Gateway adds
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`; Z.AI and Z.AI Coding CN replace
  `glm-4.5-air`, `glm-5.1`, and `glm-5v-turbo` with
  `glm-5.2-highspeed[1m]`. Static provider tests now use the still-published
  `glm-4.7` fixture or explicit compatibility overrides, and Z.AI defaults now
  resolve to `glm-5.2`, so future catalog removals cannot leave release-time
  type checking or default selection silently stale.

### Fixed

- Make explicit reasoning capability metadata authoritative across model
  discovery and request construction: a present `thinkingLevelMap` now
  supports only the listed levels, `null` remains an explicit veto, and
  model-ID inference applies only to map-less models. This prevents the CLI
  and provider payload from advertising `xhigh` or `max` when catalog metadata
  intentionally omits them
  ([#586](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/586) by
  [@realsigridjin](https://github.com/realsigridjin)).

- Align Codex SSE and WebSocket prompt-cache affinity with the official client
  by sending one stable session tuple across `prompt_cache_key`, `session-id`,
  `thread-id`, and `x-client-request-id`. The no-affinity SSE boundary for
  `cacheRetention: "none"` remains unchanged, while ordinary sessions avoid
  repeatedly re-uploading large uncached prefixes
  ([#597](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/597)).

- Recover Codex WebSocket sessions after transient transport degradation.
  Immediate follow-up requests stay on SSE during a 60-second cooldown, the
  next fresh request may probe WebSocket again, production cleanup clears the
  degraded-route state, and the existing post-start billing guard still
  prevents replaying a response that may already have started
  ([#600](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/600)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.31-2] - 2026-07-31

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Expose `StreamOptions.streamKind` so provider implementations can distinguish the primary agent loop from
  auxiliary compaction, title-generation, and helper requests. Main-loop callers opt in explicitly; an absent value
  remains auxiliary so providers fail safe instead of accidentally retaining one-shot work in a resident session.

- Support `max` reasoning for map-less GPT-5.6 Sol models across OpenAI Responses, Azure OpenAI Responses, Codex
  Responses, and OpenAI Completions. Explicit `thinkingLevelMap` values remain authoritative: a missing level on a
  present map stays unavailable, and `null` continues to veto model-ID capability detection.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Serialize unavailable Anthropic tool history into non-imitable XML-style records that omit historical call inputs,
  neutralize case-variant result envelopes, and retain only safe result context plus guidance derived from the tools
  that are actually available on the current request.

  named channels, and bare XTML open / close / separator tokens, including markers split across stream chunks.
  Recovery preserves XTML-looking inline and fenced code, runs even when no tools are registered, and remains
  isolated to Kimi-family models

### Changed

### Fixed

- Treat Anthropic `credits_required` and “credits are required” responses as non-retryable billing failures, avoiding repeated requests against an exhausted account and allowing the coding agent to pin a configured fallback immediately ([#484](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/484)).
- Classify zero-event provider-stream stalls separately from ordinary transient failures so the coding agent can apply bounded stall escalation instead of replaying a dead upstream with the full idle timeout on every retry ([#453](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/453)).
- Preserve steering and follow-up input across provider idle-timeout retries, cap only the retry continuation’s idle wait at 30 seconds, and restore the configured timeout for later ordinary turns ([#458](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/458) by [@realsigridjin](https://github.com/realsigridjin)).
- Treat provider configurations whose authentication is fully supplied through custom headers as configured, while leaving `authHeader` and genuinely unauthenticated configurations unchanged ([#472](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/472) by [@eddieparc](https://github.com/eddieparc)).
- Abort provider requests that emit no first stream event within the new stream-start timeout, producing a retryable diagnostic and tearing down the dead request without waiting for the longer in-stream idle timeout ([#451](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/451)).

Consumers using removed APIs must migrate to supported TypeBox APIs ([#7243](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/7243) by [@petrroll](https://github.com/petrroll)).

### Added

- Added per-request `fetch` injection for supported text and image provider transports; Google adapters reject non-global implementations rather than silently bypassing them.

- Added `Tool.constrainedSampling` with strict JSON Schema (`prefer`/`require`) and OpenAI Lark/regex grammar variants, enforcing provider-side constrained tool sampling across OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, Google Gemini, and Mistral. See [Constrained Sampling for Tools](README.md#constrained-sampling-for-tools).
- Added `supportsGrammarTools` and `supportsStrictTools` compatibility flags, expanded `supportsStrictMode` to Responses and Bedrock models, and generated model capability metadata to gate constrained sampling.

- Fixed OpenAI Codex cached WebSocket continuations after grammar tool calls to send only the real tool-result delta.
- Fixed constrained tool sampling across Google, Amazon Bedrock, Mistral, and Azure OpenAI Responses adapters, including model-aware strict-tool capabilities, grammar configuration validation, and malformed grammar-call replay errors.

- Fixed Kimi K3 to expose its supported low, high, and max thinking levels, and normalized the `k2p7` alias to the canonical `kimi-for-coding` model.
- Fixed the OpenCode Go provider to support models routed through the OpenAI Responses API.
- Fixed the `pi-ai` executable path to match npm registry metadata, avoiding repeated consumer lockfile changes ([#6812](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6812) by [@jmfederico](https://github.com/jmfederico)).
- Fixed sessionless OpenAI Codex WebSocket requests to use UUIDv7 request IDs, enabling models that reject UUIDv4 IDs ([#6834](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6834) by [@xl0](https://github.com/xl0)).
- Fixed GitHub Copilot long-context pricing tiers in generated model metadata ([#6668](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6668)).
- Fixed Kimi Coding subscription models to report API-equivalent implied costs when models.dev reports zero pricing.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses early stream endings to be classified as retryable provider errors ([#6727](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6727)).

- Fixed Anthropic-compatible request replay to retry once with unsigned thinking rendered as text when an endpoint rejects its signature.
- Fixed the generated Kimi Coding catalog release gate by migrating integration coverage from retired `k2p7` to the supported `kimi-for-coding` model.

### Removed

## [2026.7.20] - 2026-07-20

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added the `antml` tool-call protocol: ANTML `<function_calls>`/`<invoke>` format with Claude-Code-style failure tolerance (parameter aliases, unknown-key filtering, unicode escape repair), validation-gated so repaired calls must still pass the tool schema.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot long-context pricing tiers in generated model metadata ([#6668](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6668)).
- Fixed Kimi Coding subscription models to report API-equivalent implied costs when models.dev reports zero pricing.

### Removed

## [2026.7.17-3] - 2026-07-17

### Breaking Changes

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed payload hooks reintroducing Moonshot-incompatible function schemas by normalizing the final tool list after `onPayload` and immediately before request submission.
- Fixed model regeneration dropping the supported `kimi-for-coding` and `kimi-k2-thinking` catalog IDs when the live metadata source omits them.

### Removed

## [2026.7.17-2] - 2026-07-17

### Added

### Fixed

- Fixed Moonshot-flavored OpenAI backends by normalizing tool parameters through a dedicated compatibility layer so function schemas and result images are accepted by Moonshot's API ([#225](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/225)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.17] - 2026-07-17

### Added

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic native web search on compatible endpoints by defaulting support to `api.anthropic.com`, sanitizing unsupported native tools and replay blocks, and preserving streamed server-tool inputs; compatible models can opt in with `compat.supportsWebSearch` ([#213](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/213) by [@tmdgusya](https://github.com/tmdgusya)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.16-3] - 2026-07-16

### Added

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited OpenCode Go catalog metadata to include Grok 4.5 and Kimi K3, and refreshed OpenRouter pricing metadata from upstream v0.80.10.

### Removed

## [2026.7.16-2] - 2026-07-16

### Added

### Fixed

- Fixed Kimi Coding requests to use Anthropic adaptive thinking effort without token budgets, and enabled empty thinking signatures for K3 and `kimi-for-coding`.
- Fixed Kimi K3 pricing metadata for Moonshot AI and Moonshot AI China.
- Fixed Kimi Coding K3 thinking-level metadata to expose only the supported `max` level ([#6737](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6737)).
- Fixed catalog generation restoring xAI models removed in 0.80.9 ([#6736](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6736)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.16] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Added Kimi K3 model catalogs and deferred tool loading for compatible Kimi and OpenAI Completions routes.
- Added prefilled xAI OAuth device links, SuperGrok login labeling, and a trimmed xAI model catalog.
- Preserved fork compatibility for extension OAuth callback types and faux-provider registration through the `compat` surface.

### Fixed

- Fixed Kimi K3 output limits for Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter models.

### Removed

- Removed Grok 3, Grok 3 Fast, Grok 4.20 variants, and Grok Code Fast 1 from the built-in xAI model catalog ([#6734](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6734) by [@Jaaneek](https://github.com/Jaaneek)).

## [0.80.9] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Added Kimi K3 support for Kimi Coding, Moonshot AI, Moonshot AI China, OpenRouter, and Vercel AI Gateway.
- Added Kimi deferred tool loading to OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions through `compat.deferredToolsMode`.

### Changed

- Changed xAI device OAuth to open a prefilled authorization link and added provider-specific OAuth login labels ([#6734](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6734) by [@Jaaneek](https://github.com/Jaaneek)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Kimi K3 output limits for Vercel AI Gateway and OpenRouter models.

## [0.80.8] - 2026-07-16

### Breaking Changes

- Changed runtime authentication to provider-scoped `Models.checkAuth()`, `getAuth()`, `login()`, and `logout()` APIs. `checkAuth()` now returns `AuthCheck | undefined`, and API-key auth resolvers no longer receive a model.
- Removed the legacy built-in OAuth provider objects, global OAuth registry APIs, and public low-level built-in login/refresh functions. Use canonical `Provider.auth.oauth` methods instead; the `oauth` subpath now retains only extension compatibility types.
- Renamed the canonical login interaction interface from `AuthLoginCallbacks` to `AuthInteraction`; it exposes the provider-neutral `prompt()`/`notify()` protocol used by API-key and OAuth flows.
- Changed the `Models` request contract: `getAuth(model)` now includes model headers, while `getAuth(providerId)` remains provider-scoped, and Models stream options may include `transformHeaders`. Custom `Models` implementations must execute the transform after merging auth/model and explicit headers, then remove it before provider dispatch.
- Changed dynamic model refresh to `Models.refresh(options)`, which refreshes every configured dynamic provider and returns per-provider errors/cancellation state. `Provider.refreshModels(context)` now receives the effective credential, scoped model storage, network policy, and abort signal.

### Added

- Added provider-owned authentication and availability resolution to `Models`, including stored OAuth refresh and interactive login support through `CredentialStore`.
- Added async non-secret credential enumeration through `CredentialStore.list()` and credential-aware `Provider.filterModels()` availability policy.
- Added neutral auth-flow information/link events and provider-owned Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex AI credential selection flows.
- Added `ModelsStore` with an in-memory default for restoring and persisting dynamic provider catalogs.
- Added the dynamic Radius `pi-messages` gateway provider with OAuth and credential-specific catalog refresh.
- Added `Models.refresh({ force: true })` to let providers bypass freshness checks for explicit refreshes.
- Added xAI device-code OAuth login and routed Grok 4.5 through OpenAI Responses, with low, medium, and high thinking support ([#6651](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6651) by [@Jaaneek](https://github.com/Jaaneek)).

### Changed

- Changed `Models.getAuth(model)` to include model headers and added a Models-only `transformHeaders` stream option that runs after auth and explicit header assembly but is not forwarded to providers.

### Fixed

- Fixed Cloudflare Workers AI and AI Gateway streams to materialize account and gateway endpoint placeholders after auth resolution, including compat streaming with custom model objects.
- Fixed lazy provider streams to preserve their final assistant message when forwarding an inner stream.
- Fixed OpenAI Codex session IDs longer than 64 characters to meet the API limit ([#6630](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/6630)).

## [2026.7.14-3] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added Radius gateway support, including the `pi-messages` API, Radius OAuth helpers, and dynamic model catalogs.
- Added forced tool-call support for OpenAI Responses and OpenAI Codex providers ([#6588](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6588)).

### Changed

- Stopped sending OpenAI Responses session-id fields to OpenCode models that opt out of session IDs ([#6645](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6645) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic Messages streaming to omit empty usage fields that some endpoints reject ([#6611](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6611) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed OpenAI/Azure Responses reasoning replay to backfill `encrypted_content` from completed responses when reasoning blocks omit it ([#6608](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6608) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed Bedrock Converse streams to surface unhandled stop reasons as error messages ([#6598](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6598) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed OpenRouter session-affinity headers for OpenAI-compatible completion and Responses providers ([#6496](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6496) by [@houskape](https://github.com/houskape)).
- Fixed OpenAI Responses WebSocket session-affinity headers to use each provider's configured affinity format.
- Fixed GitHub Copilot MAI-Code models to route through the Responses endpoint ([#6544](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6544) by [@houskape](https://github.com/houskape)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.14-2] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added the `anthropic-xml` text tool-call protocol for OpenAI-compatible models that emit legacy Anthropic `<invoke>` and `<parameter>` XML, including streaming, schema-driven argument coercion, XML escaping, case-insensitive tool resolution, and bounded malformed-fragment recovery.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Preserved Anthropic server-side web search `encrypted_content` during same-model replay so follow-up turns no longer fail after native web searches ([#208](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/208)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.14] - 2026-07-14

## [2026.7.13] - 2026-07-13

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Preserved the executable bit on the `pi-ai` CLI after ordinary workspace builds, preventing release builds from recording a non-executable bin stub.

### Removed

## [2026.7.11] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Added cache-friendly dynamic tool loading. `ToolResultMessage.addedToolNames` marks where tools from `Context.tools` became available; Anthropic and OpenAI Responses use native deferred loading so late tools stay out of the cached prefix, while other providers continue using `Context.tools` normally ([#6474](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6474)).
- Added native `xhigh` and `max` thinking levels for Claude Fable 5 across all generated provider catalogs ([#6490](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6490) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed Cloudflare Workers AI / AI Gateway auth to fall back to the ambient `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (and `CLOUDFLARE_GATEWAY_ID`) when the stored credential carries only the API key, so `/login`-style key-only credentials no longer leave the `{CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID}` placeholder unresolved and return 404 ([#6021](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6021)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock auth to keep SigV4 signing for AWS profiles, IAM credentials, and roles by not treating the internal `<authenticated>` ambient-auth marker as a Bedrock bearer token in compat dispatch, while still honoring real Bedrock API keys ([#6531](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6531)).
- Fixed Anthropic deferred tool loading to ignore `addedToolNames` markers on tool results discarded by server-side fallback pruning; such markers deferred a tool while its `tool_reference` never replayed, leaving the tool unloadable.
- Fixed OpenRouter model context windows to use the top provider's actual context length ([#6481](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/6481) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock requests to use the generic `apiKey` stream option as a Bedrock bearer token.
- Prevented invalid model or request `maxTokens` metadata from reaching provider payloads by falling back to the available context budget.

### Removed

## [2026.7.10-2] - 2026-07-10

## [0.80.6] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added request-wide input-token pricing tiers to model cost metadata and usage cost calculation.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed post-compaction output-token budgeting to ignore stale assistant usage from before the compaction boundary.
- Fixed GPT-5.4, GPT-5.5, and GPT-5.6 long-context pricing metadata, while excluding the nonexistent bare `gpt-5.6` OpenAI/Azure alias.
- Fixed Anthropic message conversion to preserve thinking blocks with empty thinking text but a valid signature instead of dropping them ([#6457](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6457) by [@davidbrai](https://github.com/davidbrai)).
- Fixed Anthropic replay to send the normalized thinking signature value after signature narrowing.
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible simple streams to preserve provider-specific `max` reasoning mappings instead of clamping them.
- Fixed same-model signed thinking replay to keep non-empty signed blocks only when provider state must be replayed, while preserving empty opaque signed blocks.

### Removed

## [2026.7.9-2] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added GPT-5.6 model metadata.

### Changed

- Updated model catalogs, including GitHub Copilot extended-context windows and Xiaomi token-plan catalogs.

### Fixed

- Retried Bun socket-drop failures.
- Treated `ResourceExhausted` provider errors as retryable.
- Normalized null message content at provider ingestion boundaries.
- Used a `(no tool output)` placeholder for empty text-only tool results.

### Removed

## [2026.7.9] - 2026-07-09

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses and Azure OpenAI Responses requests to avoid sending `max_output_tokens` values below the provider minimum ([#6265](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6265)).
- Fixed Anthropic same-model replay of server-side web search results so `encrypted_content` is not sent back inside replayed search result blocks, avoiding 400 `Invalid encrypted_content in search_result block` errors on follow-up turns.

### Removed

## [2026.7.5-2] - 2026-07-05

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

## [2026.7.5] - 2026-07-05

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic same-model replay of server-side fallback (`server-side-fallback-2026-06-01` beta) turns keeping the declined pre-fallback attempt's `thinking`/`tool_use` blocks, which left the pre-fallback `tool_use` without an adjacent `tool_result` after API-side normalization and caused 400 "`tool_use` ids were found without `tool_result` blocks immediately after" on the next request. Blocks before the final `fallback` marker and their now-orphaned `tool_result`s are dropped per the fallback replay contract; the marker onward replays verbatim.
- Extended the same server-side fallback replay fix to also drop an unpaired `server_tool_use` block before the `fallback` marker (a declined attempt whose server-tool result never arrived), which would otherwise dangle and trigger its own 400. Paired server-tool blocks (a `server_tool_use` with its result) still replay verbatim.

### Removed

## [2026.7.4] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Added OpenAI GPT-5.6 model metadata for `gpt-5.6`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`, plus verified `openai-codex` support for `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna`.
- Added provider-side constrained sampling for tools via `Tool.constrainedSampling`: strict JSON-schema enforcement for OpenAI and Anthropic tool calls, and OpenAI custom grammar tools (Lark/regex). Grammar tool capability comes from the model catalog's `supportsGrammarTools` compat flag, enabled for GPT-5+ models on OpenAI, OpenAI Codex, Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, opencode, and Cloudflare AI Gateway ([#6341](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6341)).
- Refreshed generated model catalogs from models.dev, adding newly listed models including Kimi K2.7 Code for GitHub Copilot and Fable 5 to several providers ([#6256](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6256)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed OAuth device-code polling to honor the server-provided `slow_down` interval instead of only applying the RFC 8628 5-second increment, so GitHub Copilot login recovers instead of appearing to hang when polls arrive early (e.g. WSL/VM clock drift) ([#6187](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6187)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex WebSocket sessions to rotate cached connections before the backend's 60-minute limit, avoiding connection-limit failures on long sessions ([#6268](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6268)).
- Fixed retry classification for Cloudflare 524 timeout responses ([#6239](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6239)).

### Removed

## [2026.7.3] - 2026-07-03

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic same-model replay dropping server-side fallback (`server-side-fallback-2026-06-01` beta) `fallback` content blocks, which mutated the latest assistant message and caused 400 "`thinking` or `redacted_thinking` blocks in the latest assistant message cannot be modified" on the next request after a mid-response model fallback.
- Fixed inherited Amazon Bedrock prompt-cache points for Claude Fable 5 and Claude Sonnet 5.
- Fixed inherited DS4 server context overflow detection for `Prompt has ... tokens, but the configured context size is ... tokens` errors.

### Removed

## [2026.7.2] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added Claude Sonnet 5 to the GitHub Copilot model catalog ([#6200](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6200)).
- Added zstd request-body compression for the OpenAI Codex Responses SSE transport. Requests are sent with `Content-Encoding: zstd` when Node/Bun zstd support is available; the WebSocket transport is unchanged.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot device-code login polling to wait before the first token poll, avoiding incorrect device-code failures for some users after browser authorization ([#6187](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6187)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex user-agent construction to synchronously load Node OS metadata, avoiding a startup race that could report `pi (browser)` in Node/Bun.
- Fixed Fireworks GLM 5.2 Fast to use the OpenAI-compatible endpoint and `thinkingLevelMap`, aligning it with GLM 5.2 ([#6195](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6195)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock prompt-cache points for Claude Fable 5 and Claude Sonnet 5 ([#6235](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6235)).
- Fixed DS4 server context overflow detection for `Prompt has ... tokens, but the configured context size is ... tokens` errors ([#6262](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6262)).

### Removed

## [2026.6.30-2] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Added Anthropic Claude Sonnet 5 model metadata for Anthropic-compatible, Bedrock, OpenRouter, and Vercel AI Gateway providers.

### Changed

- Changed OpenAI Codex Responses SSE response-header waits to use the configured HTTP timeout instead of the previous fixed 20 second timeout, reducing false timeouts on slow connections ([#4945](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4945)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Claude Sonnet 5 metadata to use adaptive thinking payloads for Anthropic-compatible and Bedrock requests.
- Fixed generated Xiaomi MiMo model pricing to match current pay-as-you-go pricing from models.dev ([#6138](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6138)).
- Fixed provider HTTP errors to include response bodies instead of opaque SDK messages ([#5832](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5832) by [@stephanmck](https://github.com/stephanmck)).
- Fixed Z.AI preserved thinking requests to send `thinking.clear_thinking: false` when thinking is enabled, allowing replayed `reasoning_content` to participate in provider caching ([#6083](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6083)).

### Removed

## [2026.6.28] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- Added an optional `reasoning` field to `Usage` reporting reasoning/thinking token counts as a subset of `output`. Populated for Anthropic (`output_tokens_details.thinking_tokens`), OpenAI Responses/Codex/Azure (`output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`), OpenAI Completions (`completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`), and Google Generative AI / Vertex (`thoughtsTokenCount`). Bedrock Converse and Mistral are not populated because those APIs do not return a reasoning token breakdown ([#6057](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6057)).

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed Azure OpenAI Responses base URL handling for modern Microsoft Foundry endpoints ([#6004](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/6004) by [@gukoff](https://github.com/gukoff)).
- Fixed `streamSimple()` to send a context-aware max-token cap so providers that count input and output against one context window do not reject long requests ([#5595](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5595)).
- Fixed OpenAI Responses streams to preserve reasoning replay state when output items finish out of order ([#6009](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6009)).
- Fixed retry classification for provider errors that explicitly tell callers to retry the request ([#6019](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6019)).

### Removed

## [2026.6.23-2] - 2026-06-23

### Added

### Changed

- Changed `ApiKeyCredential` to use the `auth.json`-compatible discriminator `type: "api_key"` and provider-scoped `env` values instead of `type: "api-key"` and metadata.

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic-compatible custom models to use explicit compatibility metadata instead of provider-name heuristics for session-affinity headers and unsupported tool-field omissions.
- Fixed request-scoped `apiKey` and `env` values to participate in provider auth resolution, so providers such as Cloudflare can derive request-specific base URLs from explicit call options ([#6021](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6021)).
- Restored temporary legacy per-API stream aliases such as `streamSimpleOpenAICompletions` on the compat entrypoint ([#6016](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6016), [#6017](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6017)).
- Restored runtime `detectCompat` fallback in `openai-completions` for models without explicit compat metadata ([#6020](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/6020)).

### Removed

## [2026.6.23] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Added the inherited Models runtime with provider-owned auth, provider factories, per-provider catalogs, explicit refresh APIs, `ImagesModels`, and the `compat` entrypoint for existing callers.

### Changed

- Changed inherited provider implementations to live under `src/api` with lazy wrappers, and changed the root package barrel to expose the core API surface while compatibility exports move to `compat`.

### Fixed

- Fixed inherited provider auth/env handling for scoped credentials, stored auth injection, Bedrock scoped AWS profile endpoint resolution, OpenAI Responses terminal-event handling, Codex WebSocket connection-limit reconnects, and release provider tests.
- Fixed fork compatibility APIs after the Models runtime migration, including static catalog reads, faux provider registration, compat stream tool-call middleware, and restored model metadata normalization.

### Removed

- Removed inherited legacy raw API subpaths after the Models runtime migration.

## [2026.6.22] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Fixed Xiaomi and Xiaomi Token Plan model compatibility so thinking-mode conversations preserve DeepSeek-style reasoning replay requirements.
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock Claude Opus 4.7 profile metadata to use the current inference profile IDs.
- Fixed OpenCode Go GLM-5.2 metadata to expose `xhigh` reasoning and send `reasoning_effort: "max"` ([#5967](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5967)).

### Removed

- Removed the temporary `@earendil-works/pi-ai/base` entrypoint and direct provider self-registration exports.

## [0.79.10] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI-compatible streaming to preserve encrypted `reasoning_details` that arrive before matching tool call deltas ([#5114](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5114)).

- Fixed Moonshot AI China model metadata to include Kimi K2.7 Code, and omitted unsupported thinking-off payloads for Kimi K2.7 Code models ([#5760](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5760)).

## [0.79.4] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic 1-hour prompt-cache write cost accounting to price 1-hour cache writes at 2x input instead of the 5-minute cache-write rate ([#5738](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5738) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky)).

### Fixed

- Restored OpenAI GPT-5.4/GPT-5.5 and OpenAI Codex GPT-5.4/GPT-5.4 mini/GPT-5.5 context window metadata to the observed 272k-token Codex backend limit, avoiding a billing hazard from sending prompts above Codex's accepted limit (reported by [@trethore](https://github.com/trethore)).

## [0.79.2] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Added AWS data retention documentation links to Amazon Bedrock unsupported data retention mode validation errors ([#5561](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/pull/5561) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge)).

- Restored the NVIDIA Qwen 3.5 122B NIM model.

## [0.78.0] - 2026-05-29

### Breaking Changes

- Changed direct provider stream functions to require explicit `options.apiKey`; top-level `stream*`/`complete*` helpers still resolve built-in environment auth.

### Added

- Added custom Amazon Bedrock request header support via `StreamOptions.headers`, excluding reserved AWS signing headers ([#5178](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/5178) by [@stephanmck](https://github.com/stephanmck)).

- Fixed OpenCode Go Kimi K2.6 thinking requests to send `thinking` objects instead of invalid string values, and fixed OpenCode Zen Grok Build thinking requests to omit unsupported `reasoning_effort` ([#5169](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/5169)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses SSE streams to abort response body reads after terminal events.
- Fixed OpenCode Kimi K2.6 generated metadata to use Anthropic-style thinking metadata instead of invalid reasoning-effort parameters.

## [0.77.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Fixed Anthropic-compatible replay for providers that return empty thinking signatures by adding an opt-in `allowEmptySignature` compatibility flag ([#4464](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4464)).
- Fixed OpenAI and OpenRouter GPT-5.5 Pro thinking level metadata to expose only supported medium, high, and xhigh efforts.
- Fixed OpenCode Go Kimi K2.6 thinking-off requests to send `thinking: "none"` ([#5078](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5078)).
- Fixed Xiaomi Token Plan model metadata to omit unsupported `mimo-v2-flash` variants ([#5075](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5075)).

## [0.76.0] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Fixed `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex-spark` generated metadata to use its 128k context window ([#4969](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4969)).
- Fixed OpenRouter/Poolside context overflow detection for `maximum allowed input length` errors ([#4943](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4943)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses WebSocket streams and SSE response-header waits to apply bounded timeouts instead of waiting indefinitely when no events arrive ([#4945](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4945)).
- Fixed provider retry controls so OpenAI Codex Responses honors `maxRetries`, SDK retries default to `0`, and quota/billing 429s are not retried behind Pi's retry handling ([#4991](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4991) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)).

## [0.75.5] - 2026-05-23

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `OAuthLoginCallbacks` to require `onDeviceCode` and `onSelect`, so OAuth providers can rely on pi supplying device-code and selection UI callbacks ([#4788](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4788) by [@vegarsti](https://github.com/vegarsti)).

### Fixed

- Fixed custom Anthropic-compatible model aliases for adaptive-thinking Claude models by adding `compat.forceAdaptiveThinking` model metadata and moving built-in adaptive-thinking selection out of provider id substring checks ([#4797](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4797) by [@mbazso](https://github.com/mbazso)).
- Fixed GitHub Copilot OAuth login to rely on the required device-code callback without a runtime callback availability guard ([#4788](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4788) by [@vegarsti](https://github.com/vegarsti)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock provider loading under strict package managers by declaring its direct `@smithy/node-http-handler` dependency ([#4842](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4842)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock Claude requests to send the model output token cap by default, matching Anthropic requests and avoiding Bedrock's 4096-token default truncation ([#4848](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4848)).

## [0.75.4] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Changed source syntax to avoid TypeScript constructs that require JavaScript emit, keeping the package compatible with Node.js strip-only TypeScript checks.
- Removed the package-level development watch scripts now that the root TypeScript check validates strip-only-compatible sources.

### Added

- Added first-class OAuth device-code callback metadata, shared polling support, and GitHub Copilot OAuth integration.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI-compatible `streamSimple()` requests to stop sending model-derived default output token caps, avoiding context-window reservation failures on servers such as vLLM while preserving explicit `maxTokens` and required Anthropic `max_tokens` handling ([#4675](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4675)).
- Fixed OpenAI prompt cache keys to clamp session-derived values to the 64-character API limit across OpenAI Responses, Chat Completions, Codex Responses, and Azure OpenAI Responses ([#4720](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4720)).

## [0.75.3] - 2026-05-18

## [0.75.2] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Fixed Xiaomi MiMo generated model metadata to replay assistant tool-call messages with `reasoning_content` for thinking-mode multi-turn requests ([#4678](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4678)).

## [0.75.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic-compatible API-key requests to ignore unrelated `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` environment values, avoiding invalid bearer credentials for providers such as Xiaomi MiMo ([#4342](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4342)).
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock message conversion to skip unknown content blocks instead of failing the stream ([#4223](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4223)).
- Fixed Azure OpenAI Responses and OpenAI Responses error formatting to prefix HTTP status codes onto `errorMessage`, so transient 5xx and 429 errors are correctly matched by the agent-level auto-retry classifier ([#4232](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4232)).
- Fixed Xiaomi MiMo model metadata to use the OpenAI-compatible endpoints and `openai-completions` API, restoring multi-turn thinking/tool-call sessions ([#4505](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4505)).
- Fixed OpenCode Go Kimi reasoning replay by normalizing streamed `reasoning` fields back to `reasoning_content` for OpenCode Go only ([#4251](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4251)).

### Removed

- Removed non-working OpenAI Codex fast model variants.

## [0.75.0] - 2026-05-17

### Breaking Changes

- Raised the minimum supported Node.js version to 22.19.0.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex generated model metadata to use the current upstream model list ([#4603](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4603) by [@mattiacerutti](https://github.com/mattiacerutti)).
- Fixed GitHub Copilot GPT model thinking metadata to map unsupported minimal thinking to low ([#4622](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4622) by [@mattiacerutti](https://github.com/mattiacerutti)).
- Fixed `streamSimple()` defaults for models whose advertised output limit is effectively their full context window to avoid impossible default requests ([#4614](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4614)).

## [0.74.1] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Added image generation APIs, image model metadata, and built-in OpenRouter image generation support ([#3887](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/3887) by [@cristinaponcela](https://github.com/cristinaponcela)).
- Added Together AI as a built-in OpenAI-compatible provider with generated model metadata and `TOGETHER_API_KEY` authentication ([#3624](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/3624) by [@Nutlope](https://github.com/Nutlope)).

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot model availability to ignore generic `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variables, requiring OAuth login or `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` instead ([#4485](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4485)).
- Fixed `openai-completions` streams to surface an error when the stream ends before any terminal `finish_reason`, so truncated responses can retry instead of being accepted as success ([#4345](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4345)).
- Fixed Fireworks provider caching compatibility by adding session affinity headers and model metadata compat settings ([#4358](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4358) by [@yanirz](https://github.com/yanirz)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex WebSocket transport to respect proxy environment variables under Bun ([#4354](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4354) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu)).
- Fixed OpenRouter cache usage normalization to preserve cached-token semantics without treating cached tokens as cache writes.
- Fixed Bedrock proxy handling to preserve `NO_PROXY` exclusions while using HTTP(S)-only proxy agents.
- Fixed compiled Bun binaries failing to start outside the repo when Bedrock proxy support tried to resolve `proxy-from-env` from external `node_modules` ([#4513](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4513)).
- Fixed GitHub Copilot Claude test coverage to use the current Claude Sonnet 4.6 model ID.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses requests for models that support disabling reasoning to send `reasoning.effort: "none"` when thinking is off.
- Fixed Inception Mercury 2 tool calling on OpenRouter by marking `off` as unsupported in `thinkingLevelMap`, so the openai-completions provider omits the reasoning param instead of defaulting to `{reasoning:{effort:"none"}}` (which puts Mercury 2 in instant mode, disabling tool calls).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex SSE retries to honor `retry-after-ms` and `retry-after` headers before falling back to exponential backoff.
- Fixed context overflow detection for LiteLLM-wrapped OpenAI-compatible errors using `exceeds the model's maximum context length of ... tokens` wording ([#4563](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4563)).
- Fixed `streamSimple()` defaults to respect model output limits above 32000 tokens instead of clamping provider requests to 32000 ([#4539](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4539)).

## [0.74.0] - 2026-05-07

## [0.73.1] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added OAuth login flow metadata so clients can present interactive provider choices during login ([#4190](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/4190) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)).

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses reasoning text streaming for LM Studio and other compatible providers that emit `response.reasoning_text.delta` events ([#4191](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4191) by [@yaanfpv](https://github.com/yaanfpv)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex OAuth refresh failures writing directly to stderr while the TUI is active ([#4141](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4141)).
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible chat completion streams that interleave content and tool-call deltas in the same choice.
- Fixed the Kimi K2 P6 model alias to normalize to `kimi-for-coding` ([#4218](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/4218)).
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses requests to send a non-empty system prompt ([#4184](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/4184)).

## [0.73.0] - 2026-05-04

### Breaking Changes

- Switched the built-in `xiaomi` provider endpoint from Token Plan AMS (`https://token-plan-ams.xiaomimimo.com/anthropic`) to API billing (`https://api.xiaomimimo.com/anthropic`). `XIAOMI_API_KEY` now refers to the API billing key from [platform.xiaomimimo.com](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com). Users still on Token Plan must move to the appropriate `xiaomi-token-plan-*` provider and set the corresponding env var ([#4112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4112) by [@Phoen1xCode](https://github.com/Phoen1xCode)).

### Added

- Added Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan regional providers with per-region env vars: `xiaomi-token-plan-cn` (`XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_CN_API_KEY`), `xiaomi-token-plan-ams` (`XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_AMS_API_KEY`), and `xiaomi-token-plan-sgp` (`XIAOMI_TOKEN_PLAN_SGP_API_KEY`) ([#4112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4112) by [@Phoen1xCode](https://github.com/Phoen1xCode)).
- Added `registerSessionResourceCleanup()` and `cleanupSessionResources()` so providers can register cleanup hooks for session-scoped resources.

### Fixed

- Fixed generated OpenAI-compatible model metadata for Qwen 3.5/3.6 and MiniMax M2.7 to match models.dev and OpenCode Go ([#4110](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4110) by [@jsynowiec](https://github.com/jsynowiec)).
- Fixed Bedrock Converse thinking effort mapping to preserve native `xhigh` for Claude Opus 4.7.
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses WebSocket transport to fall back to SSE when setup fails before streaming starts, and attach transport diagnostics to the assistant message ([#4133](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4133)).

## [0.72.1] - 2026-05-02

## [0.72.0] - 2026-05-01

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced `OpenAICompletionsCompat.reasoningEffortMap` with top-level `Model.thinkingLevelMap` for model-specific thinking controls ([#3208](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3208)). Migration: move mappings from `model.compat.reasoningEffortMap` to `model.thinkingLevelMap`. See `packages/ai/README.md#custom-models` and `packages/coding-agent/docs/models.md#thinking-level-map`. Map values keep the same provider-specific string semantics, and `null` marks a pi thinking level unsupported. Example:
  ```ts
  // Before
  compat: { reasoningEffortMap: { high: "high", xhigh: "max" } }

  // After
  thinkingLevelMap: { minimal: null, low: null, medium: null, high: "high", xhigh: "max" }
  ```
- Removed `supportsXhigh()`. Migration: use `getSupportedThinkingLevels(model).includes("xhigh")` or `clampThinkingLevel(model, requestedLevel)` instead ([#3208](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3208)).

### Added

- Added Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan provider (Anthropic-compatible) with `XIAOMI_API_KEY` authentication ([#4005](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4005) by [@Phoen1xCode](https://github.com/Phoen1xCode)).
- Added `Model.thinkingLevelMap`, `getSupportedThinkingLevels()`, and `clampThinkingLevel()` so model metadata can describe supported thinking levels and provider-specific level values ([#3208](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3208)).

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses `streamSimple()` to honor the configured transport instead of always using SSE, and made `auto` the default transport with cached WebSocket context when available ([#4083](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4083)).
- Fixed Xiaomi MiMo model catalog to use the Token Plan Anthropic endpoint instead of the direct API ([#3912](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3912)).

## [0.71.1] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Added `websocket-cached` transport support for OpenAI Codex Responses used with ChatGPT subscription auth. This keeps the same WebSocket open for a session and, after the first request, sends only new conversation items instead of resending the full chat history when possible.

## [0.71.0] - 2026-04-30

### Breaking Changes

- Removed built-in Google Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity support, including provider registration, model metadata, OAuth, and package exports. Existing callers must switch to another supported provider.

### Added

- Added Cloudflare AI Gateway as a built-in provider with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Workers AI gateway routing plus `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`/`CLOUDFLARE_GATEWAY_ID` authentication ([#3856](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3856) by [@mchenco](https://github.com/mchenco)).
- Added Moonshot AI as a built-in OpenAI-compatible provider with model catalog generation and `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` authentication.
- Added Mistral Medium 3.5 model metadata and reasoning-mode handling ([#4009](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/4009) by [@technocidal](https://github.com/technocidal)).
- Added `AssistantMessage.responseModel` on the openai-completions path: surfaces the concrete `chunk.model` when it differs from the requested id (e.g. OpenRouter `auto` -> `anthropic/...`) ([#3968](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3968) by [@purrgrammer](https://github.com/purrgrammer)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Google Vertex Gemini 3 tool call replay by no longer sending the non-Vertex `skip_thought_signature_validator` sentinel for unsigned tool calls ([#4032](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/4032)).
- Updated `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to `^0.91.1` to clear GHSA-p7fg-763f-g4gf audit findings ([#3992](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3992)).
- Fixed DeepSeek V4 Flash `xhigh` thinking support so requests preserve `xhigh` and map it to DeepSeek's `max` reasoning effort ([#3944](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3944)).
- Fixed Anthropic streams that end before `message_stop` to be treated as errors instead of successful partial responses ([#3936](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3936)).
- Fixed generated OpenAI-compatible DeepSeek V4 models to carry the provider-specific reasoning effort mapping outside the direct DeepSeek provider ([#3940](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3940)).
- Fixed DeepSeek V4 Flash and V4 Pro pricing metadata to match current official rates ([#3910](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3910)).
- Fixed DeepSeek prompt cache hits to be tracked from `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` in OpenAI-compatible usage responses ([#3880](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3880)).

### Removed

- Removed built-in Google Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity provider, model, OAuth, and export support.

## [0.70.6] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Added Cloudflare Workers AI as a built-in provider with model catalog generation, `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` authentication, and OpenAI-compatible streaming support ([#3851](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3851) by [@mchenco](https://github.com/mchenco)).

### Fixed

- Removed generated Cloudflare Workers AI `User-Agent` model headers so attribution can be controlled by callers.
- Fixed Bedrock inference profile capability checks by normalizing profile ARNs to the underlying model name.

## [0.70.5] - 2026-04-27

## [0.70.4] - 2026-04-27

## [0.70.3] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Added Azure Cognitive Services endpoint support for Azure OpenAI Responses base URLs ([#3799](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3799) by [@marcbloech](https://github.com/marcbloech)).

### Changed

- Changed OpenAI Codex Responses default text verbosity to `low` when no verbosity is specified.

### Fixed

- Fixed API-key environment discovery to fall back to `/proc/self/environ` when Bun's sandbox leaves `process.env` empty ([#3801](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3801) by [@mdsjip](https://github.com/mdsjip)).
- Fixed Bedrock prompt-caching and adaptive-thinking capability checks to use the model name when the model id is an inference profile ARN ([#3527](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3527) by [@anirudhmarc](https://github.com/anirudhmarc)).
- Fixed Anthropic SSE parsing to ignore unknown proxy events such as OpenAI-style `done` terminators ([#3708](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3708)).
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible prompt cache tests to cover proxies that explicitly disable long cache retention.
- Stopped sending `tools: []` on OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Codex Responses, and Azure OpenAI Responses requests when no tools are active (e.g. `pi --no-tools`). DashScope/Aliyun Qwen (OpenAI-compatible) rejects empty tools arrays with `"[] is too short - 'tools'"` (HTTP 400); the field is now omitted unless the conversation has tool history (the existing LiteLLM/Anthropic-proxy workaround) ([#3650](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3650) by [@HQidea](https://github.com/HQidea)).
- Fixed `supportsXhigh()` to recognize DeepSeek V4 Pro, preserving `xhigh` reasoning requests so they map to DeepSeek's `max` effort ([#3662](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3662))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible DeepSeek V4 model replay to include empty `reasoning_content` on assistant messages when needed, preventing OpenRouter DeepSeek V4 sessions from failing after responses without reasoning deltas ([#3668](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3668))

## [0.70.2] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI/Azure/Anthropic provider request option forwarding to omit undefined `timeout`/`maxRetries`, avoiding SDK validation errors such as `timeout must be an integer` when provider controls are not set ([#3627](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3627))

## [0.70.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Added DeepSeek as a built-in OpenAI-compatible provider with V4 Flash and V4 Pro models and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` authentication.

### Fixed

- Fixed DeepSeek V4 session replay 400 errors by adding `thinkingFormat: "deepseek"` (sends `thinking: { type }` + `reasoning_effort`), a `reasoningEffortMap`, and `requiresReasoningContentOnAssistantMessages` compat that injects empty `reasoning_content` on all replayed assistant messages when reasoning is enabled ([#3636](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3636))
- Fixed GPT-5.5 generated context window metadata to use the observed 272k limit.
- Fixed provider request controls to expose `timeoutMs` and `maxRetries` in stream options and forward them through OpenAI/Azure/Anthropic request options, preventing unconfigurable SDK timeout/retry defaults on long-running local inference requests ([#3627](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3627))

## [0.70.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Added GPT-5.5 to OpenAI Codex model generation.
- Added `findEnvKeys()` so callers can identify configured provider API-key environment variables without exposing credential values while preserving `getEnvApiKey()` as the credential-value API.

### Fixed

- Fixed `google-vertex` to forward custom `model.baseUrl` values to `@google/genai`, enabling Vertex proxy and gateway endpoints ([#3619](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3619))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible completion usage parsing to stop double-counting reasoning tokens already included in `completion_tokens` ([#3581](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3581))
- Fixed long cache retention compatibility by adding `compat.supportsLongCacheRetention`, allowing Anthropic Messages and OpenAI-compatible proxies to explicitly disable long-retention fields while enabling long retention by default when requested ([#3543](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3543))
- Fixed `openai-responses` compatibility by adding `compat.sendSessionIdHeader: false`, allowing strict OpenAI-compatible proxies to omit the underscore-containing `session_id` header while still sending other session-affinity headers ([#3579](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3579))
- Fixed `anthropic-messages` tool streaming compatibility by adding `compat.supportsEagerToolInputStreaming`, allowing Anthropic-compatible providers to omit per-tool `eager_input_streaming` and use the legacy fine-grained tool streaming beta header instead ([#3575](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3575))
- Fixed `supportsXhigh()` to recognize `openai-codex` `gpt-5.5`, preserving `xhigh` reasoning requests instead of clamping them to `high`.
- Fixed `openai-completions` streamed tool-call assembly to coalesce deltas by stable tool index when OpenAI-compatible gateways mutate tool call IDs mid-stream, preventing malformed Kimi K2.6/OpenCode tool streams from splitting one call into multiple bogus tool calls ([#3576](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3576))
- Fixed `packages/ai` E2E coverage to use currently supported OpenAI Responses and OpenAI Codex models, and updated the Bedrock adaptive-thinking payload expectation to match the current `display: "summarized"` shape.
- Fixed built-in `kimi-coding` model generation to attach `User-Agent: KimiCLI/1.5` to all generated Kimi models, overriding the Anthropic SDK default UA so direct Kimi Coding requests use the provider's expected client identity ([#3586](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3586))
- Fixed GPT-5.5 Codex capability handling to clamp unsupported minimal reasoning to `low` and apply the model's 2.5x priority service-tier pricing multiplier ([#3618](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3618) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.69.0] - 2026-04-22

### Breaking Changes

- Migrated TypeBox support from `@sinclair/typebox` 0.34.x plus AJV to `typebox` 1.x plus TypeBox's built-in validator and value-conversion APIs. Tool argument validation now runs in eval-restricted JavaScript runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers and other environments that disallow `eval` / `new Function`, instead of being silently skipped. Migration: install and import from `typebox` instead of `@sinclair/typebox`, and retest any coercion-sensitive tool paths that serialize schemas to plain JSON because those now go through the new TypeBox-based validation and coercion path rather than AJV ([#3112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3112))

### Fixed

- Fixed `google-gemini-cli` built-in model discovery to include `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, so Cloud Code Assist model lists expose it without requiring manual `--model` fallback selection ([#3545](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3545))
- Fixed `transformMessages()` to synthesize missing trailing tool results for transcripts that end with unresolved assistant tool calls during direct low-level history replay ([#3555](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3555))

## [0.68.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Added Fireworks provider support via Fireworks' Anthropic-compatible Messages API, including built-in models sourced from models.dev and `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` auth ([#3519](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3519))

### Fixed

- Hardened Anthropic streaming against malformed tool-call JSON by owning SSE parsing with defensive JSON repair, replacing the deprecated `fine-grained-tool-streaming` beta header with per-tool `eager_input_streaming`, and updating stale test model references ([#3175](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3175))
- Fixed Bedrock runtime endpoint resolution to stop pinning built-in regional endpoints over `AWS_REGION` / `AWS_PROFILE`, restoring `us.*` and `eu.*` inference profile support after v0.68.0 while preserving custom VPC/proxy endpoint overrides ([#3481](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3481), [#3485](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3485), [#3486](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3486), [#3487](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3487), [#3488](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3488))

## [0.68.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Added `PI_OAUTH_CALLBACK_HOST` support for built-in Anthropic, Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, and OpenAI Codex OAuth flows, allowing local callback servers to bind to a custom interface instead of hardcoded `127.0.0.1` ([#3409](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3409) by [@Michaelliv](https://github.com/Michaelliv))

### Changed

- Changed Bedrock Converse requests to omit `inferenceConfig.maxTokens` when model token limits are unknown and to omit `temperature` when unset, letting Bedrock use model defaults and avoid unnecessary TPM quota reservation ([#3400](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3400) by [@wirjo](https://github.com/wirjo))

### Fixed

- Fixed `openai-completions` `compat.requiresThinkingAsText` assistant replay to preserve text-part serialization and avoid same-model crashes when prior assistant messages contain both thinking and text ([#3387](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3387))
- Fixed Cloud Code Assist tool schemas to strip JSON Schema meta-declaration keys such as `$schema`, `$defs`, and `definitions` before sending OpenAPI `parameters`, avoiding provider validation failures for tool-enabled requests ([#3412](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3412) by [@vladlearns](https://github.com/vladlearns))
- Fixed non-vision model requests to replace user and tool-result image blocks with explicit text placeholders instead of silently dropping them during provider payload conversion ([#3429](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3429))
- Fixed direct OpenAI Chat Completions requests to map `sessionId` and `cacheRetention` to OpenAI prompt caching fields, sending `prompt_cache_key` when caching is enabled and `prompt_cache_retention: "24h"` for direct `api.openai.com` requests with long retention ([#3426](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3426))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions requests to optionally send aligned `session_id`, `x-client-request-id`, and `x-session-affinity` session-affinity headers from `sessionId` via `compat.sendSessionAffinityHeaders`, enabling cache-affinity routing for backends such as Fireworks ([#3430](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3430))
- Fixed direct Bedrock runtime client construction to pass `model.baseUrl` through as the SDK `endpoint`, restoring support for custom Bedrock endpoints such as VPC or proxy routes ([#3402](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3402) by [@wirjo](https://github.com/wirjo))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions Anthropic-style prompt caching to apply `cache_control` markers to the system prompt, last tool definition, and last user/assistant text content via `compat.cacheControlFormat`, and enabled that compat for OpenCode/OpenCode Go Qwen 3.5/3.6 Plus models so prompt caching works there too ([#3392](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3392))

## [0.67.68] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Fixed Bedrock bearer-token authentication to use the SDK's native token auth path and omit Claude `thinking.display` for GovCloud targets, avoiding duplicate `Authorization` headers and GovCloud Converse validation errors ([#3359](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3359))
- Fixed direct Mistral tool definitions to strip TypeBox symbol metadata before passing schemas to the SDK, restoring tool calls after the SDK's stricter outbound validation ([#3361](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3361))

## [0.67.67] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Added Bedrock Converse bearer-token authentication via `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, enabling API-key style access without SigV4 credentials ([#3125](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3125) by [@wirjo](https://github.com/wirjo))

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic and Bedrock adaptive-thinking payload tests to expect the default `display: "summarized"` field when reasoning is enabled.
- Fixed Mistral Small 4 reasoning requests to use `reasoning_effort` instead of `prompt_mode`, restoring default thinking support for `mistral-small-2603` and `mistral-small-latest` ([#3338](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3338))
- Fixed `qwen-chat-template` OpenAI-compatible requests to set `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking: true`, preserving prior Qwen thinking across turns so multi-turn tool calls keep their arguments instead of degrading to empty `{}` payloads ([#3325](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3325))
- Fixed OpenAI Codex service-tier accounting to trust the explicitly requested tier when the API echoes the default tier in responses, keeping downstream usage costs aligned with the caller-selected tier ([#3307](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3307) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.67.6] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added `onResponse` to `StreamOptions` so callers can inspect provider HTTP status and headers after each response arrives and before the response stream is consumed ([#3128](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3128))
- Added `thinkingDisplay` (`"summarized" | "omitted"`) to `AnthropicOptions` and `BedrockOptions`, wiring it through to the Anthropic/Bedrock `thinking` config. Defaults to `"summarized"` so Claude Opus 4.7 and Mythos Preview keep returning thinking text; set it to `"omitted"` to skip thinking streaming for faster time-to-first-text-token.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses prompt caching for non-`api.openai.com` base URLs (OpenAI-compatible proxies such as litellm, theclawbay) by sending the `session_id` and `x-client-request-id` cache-affinity headers unconditionally when a `sessionId` is provided, matching the official Codex CLI behavior ([#3264](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3264) by [@vegarsti](https://github.com/vegarsti))

## [0.67.5] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Fixed Opus 4.7 adaptive thinking configuration across Anthropic and Bedrock providers by recognizing Opus 4.7 adaptive-thinking support and mapping `xhigh` reasoning to provider-supported effort values ([#3286](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3286) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.67.4] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- Added `claude-opus-4-7` model for Anthropic, OpenRouter.
- Changed Anthropic prompt caching to add a `cache_control` breakpoint on the last tool definition, so tool schemas can be cached independently from transcript updates while preserving existing cache retention behavior ([#3260](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3260))
- Changed Kimi Coding model generation to normalize deprecated `k2p5` to `kimi-for-coding` from models.dev data and removed the old static fallback model list ([#3242](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/3242))

## [0.67.3] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- Fixed `google-vertex` API key resolution to treat `gcp-vertex-credentials` as an Application Default Credentials marker instead of a literal API key, so marker-based setups correctly fall back to ADC ([#3221](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3221) by [@deepkilo](https://github.com/deepkilo))

## [0.67.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- Fixed direct OpenAI Responses requests to send aligned `prompt_cache_key`, `session_id`, and `x-client-request-id` values when `sessionId` is provided, improving prompt cache affinity for append-only sessions ([#3018](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/3018) by [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete))
- Fixed streaming-only `partialJson` scratch buffers leaking into persisted OpenAI Responses tool calls, which could corrupt follow-up payloads on resumed conversations.

## [0.67.1] - 2026-04-13

## [0.67.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Added full `OpenRouterRouting` field support, including fallbacks, parameter requirements, data collection, ZDR, ignore lists, quantizations, provider sorting, max price, and preferred throughput and latency constraints ([#2904](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2904) by [@zmberber](https://github.com/zmberber))

### Fixed

- Bumped default Antigravity User-Agent version to `1.21.9` ([#2901](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2901) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))
- Fixed thinking levels for Gemma 4 models to use `thinkingLevel` and map Pi reasoning levels to the model's supported thinking levels ([#2903](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2903) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))
- Fixed Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite minimal thinking budget to use the model's supported 512-token minimum instead of the regular Flash 128-token minimum, avoiding invalid thinking budget errors ([#2861](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2861) by [@JasonOA888](https://github.com/JasonOA888))
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses requests to forward configured `serviceTier` values, restoring service-tier selection for Codex sessions ([#2996](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2996) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.66.1] - 2026-04-08

## [0.66.0] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- Fixed bare `readline` import to use `node:readline` prefix for Deno compatibility ([#2885](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2885) by [@milosv-vtool](https://github.com/milosv-vtool))

## [0.65.2] - 2026-04-06

## [0.65.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI-compatible completions streaming usage to preserve `prompt_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens` and normalize OpenRouter `cached_tokens` to previous-request cache hits only, preventing cache read/write double counting in `usage` and cost calculation ([#2802](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2802))

## [0.65.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- Added tool streaming support for newer Z.ai models ([#2732](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2732) by [@kaofelix](https://github.com/kaofelix))

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic context overflow detection to recognize HTTP 413 `request_too_large` errors, so callers can trigger compaction and retry instead of getting stuck on repeated oversized-image requests ([#2734](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2734))
- Fixed OpenAI Responses tool-call streaming to emit a `toolcall_delta` when function call arguments arrive only in `response.function_call_arguments.done`, and to emit only the missing suffix when `.done` extends earlier streamed arguments ([#2745](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2745))
- Fixed Bedrock throttling errors being misidentified as context overflow, causing unnecessary compaction instead of retry ([#2699](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2699) by [@xu0o0](https://github.com/xu0o0))

## [0.64.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Added opt-in faux provider helpers for deterministic tests and scripted demos: `registerFauxProvider()`, `fauxAssistantMessage()`, `fauxText()`, `fauxThinking()`, and `fauxToolCall()`.

## [0.63.2] - 2026-03-29

## [0.63.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Added `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools` model support for the `google-vertex` provider ([#2610](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2610) by [@gordonhwc](https://github.com/gordonhwc))

### Fixed

- Fixed context overflow detection to recognize Ollama error responses like `prompt too long; exceeded max context length ...`, so callers can trigger compaction and retry instead of surfacing the raw overflow error ([#2626](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2626))

## [0.63.0] - 2026-03-27

### Breaking Changes

- Removed deprecated direct `minimax` and `minimax-cn` model IDs, keeping only `MiniMax-M2.7` and `MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed`. Update pinned model IDs to one of those supported direct MiniMax models, or use another provider route that still exposes the older IDs ([#2596](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2596) by [@liyuan97](https://github.com/liyuan97))

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot OpenAI Responses requests to omit the `reasoning` field entirely when no reasoning effort is requested, avoiding `400` errors from Copilot `gpt-5-mini` rejecting `reasoning: { effort: "none" }` during internal summary calls ([#2567](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2567))
- Fixed Google and Vertex cost calculation to subtract cached prompt tokens from billable input tokens instead of double-counting them when providers report `cachedContentTokenCount` ([#2588](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2588) by [@sparkleMing](https://github.com/sparkleMing))

## [0.62.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- Added `requestMetadata` option to `BedrockOptions` for AWS cost allocation tagging; key-value pairs are forwarded to the Bedrock Converse API `requestMetadata` field and appear in AWS Cost Explorer split cost allocation data ([#2511](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2511) by [@wjonaskr](https://github.com/wjonaskr))
- Exported `BedrockOptions` type from the package root entry point, consistent with other provider option types.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses replay for foreign tool-call item IDs by hashing foreign `function_call.id` values into bounded `fc_<hash>` IDs instead of preserving backend-specific normalized shapes that OpenAI Codex rejects.
- Fixed Anthropic thinking disable handling to send `thinking: { type: "disabled" }` for reasoning-capable models when thinking is explicitly off, and added payload and env-gated end-to-end coverage for the Anthropic provider ([#2022](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2022))
- Fixed explicit thinking disable handling across Google, Google Vertex, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Responses, Azure OpenAI Responses, and OpenRouter-backed OpenAI-compatible completions. Gemini 3 models now fall back to the lowest supported thinking level when full disable is not supported, and OpenAI/OpenRouter reasoning models now send explicit `none` effort instead of relying on provider defaults ([#2490](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2490))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible completions streams to ignore null chunks instead of crashing ([#2466](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2466) by [@Cheng-Zi-Qing](https://github.com/Cheng-Zi-Qing))

## [0.61.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

- Changed MiniMax model metadata to add missing `MiniMax-M2.1-highspeed` entries for the `minimax` and `minimax-cn` providers and normalize MiniMax Anthropic-compatible context limits to the provider's supported model set ([#2445](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2445) by [@1500256797](https://github.com/1500256797))

## [0.61.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.4-mini` model support for the `openai-codex` provider with Codex pricing metadata and unit coverage ([#2334](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2334) by [@justram](https://github.com/justram))

### Fixed

- Fixed `validateToolArguments()` to fall back gracefully when AJV schema compilation is blocked in restricted runtimes such as Cloudflare Workers, allowing tool execution to proceed without schema validation ([#2395](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2395))
- Fixed `google-vertex` API key resolution to ignore placeholder auth markers like `<authenticated>` and fall back to ADC instead of sending them as literal API keys ([#2335](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2335))
- Fixed OpenRouter reasoning requests to use the provider's nested `reasoning.effort` payload instead of OpenAI's `reasoning_effort`, restoring thinking level support for OpenRouter models ([#2298](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2298) by [@PriNova](https://github.com/PriNova))
- Fixed Bedrock prompt caching for application inference profiles by allowing cache points to be forced with `AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_CACHE=1` when the profile ARN does not expose the underlying Claude model name ([#2346](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2346) by [@haoqixu](https://github.com/haoqixu))

## [0.60.0] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- Fixed Gemini 3 and Antigravity image tool results to stay inline as multimodal tool responses instead of being rerouted through separate follow-up messages ([#2052](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2052))
- Fixed Bedrock Claude 4.6 model metadata to use the correct 200K context window instead of 1M ([#2305](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2305))
- Fixed lazy built-in provider registration so compiled Bun binaries can still load providers on first use without eagerly bundling provider SDKs ([#2314](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2314))
- Fixed built-in OAuth callback flows to share aligned callback handling across Anthropic, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and OpenAI Codex, and fixed OpenAI Codex login to resolve immediately after callback completion ([#2316](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2316))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible z.ai `network_error` responses to surface as errors so callers can retry them instead of treating them as successful assistant messages ([#2313](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2313))
- Fixed OpenAI Responses replay to normalize oversized resumed tool call IDs before sending them back to Codex and other Responses-compatible targets ([#2328](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2328))

## [0.59.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Added `client` injection support to `AnthropicOptions`, allowing callers to provide a pre-built Anthropic-compatible client instead of constructing one internally.

### Changed

- Lazy-load built-in provider modules and root provider wrappers so importing `@mariozechner/pi-ai` no longer eagerly loads provider SDKs, significantly reducing base startup cost without changing dependency installation footprint ([#2297](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2297))

### Fixed

- Added provider-specific `responseId` support on `AssistantMessage` for providers that expose upstream response or message identifiers, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Gemini CLI, and Mistral, and added end-to-end coverage for supported OAuth and API key providers ([#2245](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2245))
- Fixed Claude 4.6 context window overrides in generated model metadata so build-time catalogs reflect the intended values ([#2286](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2286))

## [0.58.4] - 2026-03-16

## [0.58.3] - 2026-03-15

## [0.58.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic OAuth manual login and token refresh by using the localhost callback URI for pasted redirect/code flows and omitting `scope` from refresh-token requests ([#2169](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2169))

## [0.58.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex websocket protocol to include required headers and properly terminate SSE streams on connection close ([#1961](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1961))
- Fixed Bedrock prompt caching being enabled for non-Claude models, causing API errors ([#2053](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2053))
- Fixed Qwen models via OpenAI-compatible providers by adding `qwen-chat-template` compat mode that uses Qwen's native chat template format ([#2020](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2020))
- Fixed Bedrock unsigned thinking replay to handle edge cases with empty or malformed thinking blocks ([#2063](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2063))
- Fixed xhigh reasoning effort detection for Claude Opus 4.6 to match by model ID instead of requiring explicit capability flag ([#2040](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2040))
- Handle `finish_reason: "end"` from Ollama/LM Studio by mapping it to `"stop"` instead of throwing ([#2142](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2142))

## [0.58.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added `GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY` environment variable support for the `google-vertex` provider as an alternative to Application Default Credentials ([#1976](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1976) by [@gordonhwc](https://github.com/gordonhwc))

### Changed

- Raised Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, and related Bedrock model context windows from 200K to 1M tokens ([#2135](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2135) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot device-code login polling to respect OAuth slow-down intervals, wait before the first token poll, and include a clearer clock-drift hint in WSL/VM environments when repeated slow-downs lead to timeout.
- Fixed usage statistics not being captured for OpenAI-compatible providers that return usage in `choice.usage` instead of the standard `chunk.usage` (e.g., Moonshot/Kimi) ([#2017](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2017))
- Fixed tool result images not being sent in `function_call_output` items for OpenAI Responses API providers, causing image data to be silently dropped in tool results ([#2104](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/2104))
- Fixed assistant content being sent as structured content blocks instead of plain strings in the `openai-completions` provider, causing errors with some OpenAI-compatible backends ([#2008](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/2008) by [@geraldoaax](https://github.com/geraldoaax))
- Fixed error details in OpenAI Responses `response.failed` handler to include status code, error code, and message instead of a generic failure ([#1956](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1956) by [@drewburr](https://github.com/drewburr))

## [0.57.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- Fixed context overflow detection to recognize z.ai `model_context_window_exceeded` errors surfaced through OpenAI-compatible stop reason handling ([#1937](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1937))

## [0.57.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Added per-request payload inspection and replacement hook support via `beforeProviderRequest`, allowing callers to inspect or replace provider payloads before sending.

## [0.56.3] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Added `claude-sonnet-4-6` model for the `google-antigravity` provider ([#1859](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1859)).
- Bumped default Antigravity User-Agent version to `1.18.4` ([#1859](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1859)).

### Fixed

- Fixed Antigravity Claude thinking beta header detection to use provider and model capability instead of `-thinking` suffix, so models like `claude-sonnet-4-6` receive the header correctly ([#1859](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1859)).
- Fixed OpenAI Responses reasoning replay regression that dropped reasoning blocks on follow-up turns ([#1878](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1878))

## [0.56.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.4` model support for `openai`, `openai-codex`, `azure-openai-responses`, and `opencode` providers, with GPT-5.4 treated as xhigh-capable and capped to a 272000 context window in built-in metadata.
- Added `gpt-5.3-codex` fallback model availability for `github-copilot` until upstream model catalogs include it ([#1853](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1853)).

### Fixed

- Preserved OpenAI Responses assistant `phase` metadata (`commentary`, `final_answer`) across turns by encoding `id` and `phase` in `textSignature` for session persistence and replay, with backward compatibility for legacy plain signatures ([#1819](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1819)).
- Fixed OpenAI Responses replay to omit empty thinking blocks, avoiding invalid no-op reasoning items in follow-up turns.
- Switched the Mistral provider from the OpenAI-compatible completions path to Mistral's native SDK and conversations API, preserving native thinking blocks and Mistral-specific message semantics across turns ([#1716](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1716)).
- Fixed Antigravity endpoint fallback: 403/404 responses now cascade to the next endpoint instead of throwing immediately, added `autopush-cloudcode-pa.sandbox` endpoint to the fallback list, and removed extra fingerprint headers (`X-Goog-Api-Client`, `Client-Metadata`) from Antigravity requests ([#1830](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1830)).
- Fixed `@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth` package exports to point directly at built `dist` files, avoiding broken TypeScript resolution through unpublished wrapper targets ([#1856](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1856)).
- Fixed Gemini 3 unsigned tool call replay: use `skip_thought_signature_validator` sentinel instead of converting function calls to text, preserving structured tool call context across multi-turn conversations ([#1829](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1829)).

## [0.56.1] - 2026-03-05

## [0.56.0] - 2026-03-04

### Breaking Changes

- Moved Node OAuth runtime exports off the top-level package entry. Import OAuth login/refresh functions from `@mariozechner/pi-ai/oauth` instead of `@mariozechner/pi-ai` ([#1814](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1814))

### Added

- Added `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` fallback model entry for the `google` provider so it remains selectable until upstream model catalogs include it ([#1785](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1785), thanks [@n-WN](https://github.com/n-WN)).
- Added OpenCode Go provider support with `opencode-go` model catalog entries and `OPENCODE_API_KEY` environment variable support ([#1757](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1757)).

### Changed

- Updated Antigravity Gemini 3.1 model metadata and request headers to match current upstream behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed Gemini 3.1 thinking-level detection in `google` and `google-vertex` providers so `gemini-3.1-*` models use Gemini 3 level-based thinking config instead of budget fallback ([#1785](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1785), thanks [@n-WN](https://github.com/n-WN)).
- Fixed browser bundling failures by lazy-loading the Bedrock provider and removing Node-only side effects from the default browser import graph ([#1814](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1814)).
- Fixed `ERR_VM_DYNAMIC_IMPORT_CALLBACK_MISSING` failures by replacing `Function`-based dynamic imports with module dynamic imports in browser-safe provider loading paths ([#1814](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1814)).
- Fixed Bedrock region resolution for `AWS_PROFILE` by honoring `region` from the selected profile when present ([#1800](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1800)).
- Fixed Groq Qwen3 reasoning effort mapping by translating unsupported effort values to provider-supported values ([#1745](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1745)).

- Fixed `redacted_thinking` blocks being silently dropped during Anthropic streaming. They are now captured as `ThinkingContent` with `redacted: true`, passed back to the API in multi-turn conversations, and handled in cross-model message transformation ([#1665](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1665) by [@tctev](https://github.com/tctev))
- Fixed `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` beta header being sent for adaptive thinking models (Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6) where the header is deprecated or redundant ([#1665](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1665) by [@tctev](https://github.com/tctev))
- Fixed temperature being sent alongside extended thinking, which is incompatible with both adaptive and budget-based thinking modes ([#1665](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1665) by [@tctev](https://github.com/tctev))
- Fixed `(external, cli)` user-agent flag causing 401 errors on Anthropic setup-token endpoint ([#1677](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/1677) by [@LazerLance777](https://github.com/LazerLance777))
- Fixed crash when OpenAI-compatible provider returns a chunk with no `choices` array by adding optional chaining ([#1671](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/1671))

## [0.55.1] - 2026-02-26

## [0.52.6] - 2026-02-05

## [0.52.5] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fixed `supportsXhigh()` to treat Anthropic Messages Opus 4.6 models as xhigh-capable so `streamSimple` can map `xhigh` to adaptive effort `max`

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses API 400 error "function_call without required reasoning item" when switching between models (same provider, different model). The fix omits the `id` field for function_calls from different models to avoid triggering OpenAI's reasoning/function_call pairing validation ([#886](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/886))

## [0.49.2] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- Added AWS credential detection for ECS/Kubernetes environments: `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI`, `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI`, `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` ([#848](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/848))

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses 400 error "reasoning without following item" by skipping errored/aborted assistant messages entirely in transform-messages.ts ([#838](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/838))

### Removed

- Removed `strictResponsesPairing` compat option (no longer needed after the transform-messages fix)

## [0.49.1] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- Added `OpenAIResponsesCompat` interface with `strictResponsesPairing` option for Azure OpenAI Responses API, which requires strict reasoning/message pairing in history replay ([#768](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/768) by [@prateekmedia](https://github.com/prateekmedia))

### Changed

- Split `OpenAICompat` into `OpenAICompletionsCompat` and `OpenAIResponsesCompat` for type-safe API-specific compat settings

### Fixed

- Fixed tool call ID normalization for cross-provider handoffs (e.g., Codex to Antigravity Claude) ([#821](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/821))

## [0.49.0] - 2026-01-17

### Changed

- OpenAI Codex responses now use the context system prompt directly in the instructions field.

### Fixed

- Fixed orphaned tool results after errored assistant messages causing Codex API errors. When an assistant message has `stopReason: "error"`, its tool calls are now excluded from pending tool tracking, preventing synthetic tool results from being generated for calls that will be dropped by provider-specific converters. ([#812](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/812))
- Fixed Bedrock Claude max_tokens handling to always exceed thinking budget tokens, preventing compaction failures. ([#797](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/797) by [@pjtf93](https://github.com/pjtf93))
- Fixed Claude Code tool name normalization to match the Claude Code tool list case-insensitively and remove invalid mappings.

## [0.48.0] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI-compatible provider feature detection to use `model.provider` in addition to URL, allowing custom base URLs (e.g., proxies) to work correctly with provider-specific settings ([#774](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/774))
- Fixed Gemini 3 context loss when switching from providers without thought signatures: unsigned tool calls are now converted to text with anti-mimicry notes instead of being skipped
- Fixed string numbers in tool arguments not being coerced to numbers during validation ([#786](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/786) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- Fixed Bedrock tool call IDs to use only alphanumeric characters, avoiding API errors from invalid characters ([#781](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/781) by [@pjtf93](https://github.com/pjtf93))
- Fixed empty error assistant messages (from 429/500 errors) breaking the tool_use to tool_result chain by filtering them in `transformMessages`

## [0.47.0] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenCode provider's `/v1` endpoint to use `system` role instead of `developer` role, fixing `400 Incorrect role information` error for models using `openai-completions` API ([#755](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/755) by [@melihmucuk](https://github.com/melihmucuk))
- Added retry logic to OpenAI Codex provider for transient errors (429, 5xx, connection failures). Uses exponential backoff with up to 3 retries. ([#733](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/733))

## [0.46.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- Added MiniMax China (`minimax-cn`) provider support ([#725](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/725) by [@tallshort](https://github.com/tallshort))
- Added `gpt-5.2-codex` models for GitHub Copilot and OpenCode Zen providers ([#734](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/734) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))

### Fixed

- Avoid unsigned Gemini 3 tool calls ([#741](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/741) by [@roshanasingh4](https://github.com/roshanasingh4))
- Fixed signature support for non-Anthropic models in Amazon Bedrock provider ([#727](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/727) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge))

## [0.45.7] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses timeout option handling ([#706](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/706) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- Fixed Bedrock tool call conversion to apply message transforms ([#707](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/707) by [@pjtf93](https://github.com/pjtf93))

## [0.45.6] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- Export `parseStreamingJson` from main package for tsx dev mode compatibility

## [0.45.5] - 2026-01-13

## [0.45.4] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- Added Vercel AI Gateway provider with model discovery and `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` env support ([#689](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/689) by [@timolins](https://github.com/timolins))

### Fixed

- Fixed z.ai thinking/reasoning: z.ai uses `thinking: { type: "enabled" }` instead of OpenAI's `reasoning_effort`. Added `thinkingFormat` compat flag to handle this. ([#688](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/688))

## [0.45.3] - 2026-01-13

## [0.45.2] - 2026-01-13

## [0.45.1] - 2026-01-13

## [0.45.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- MiniMax provider support with M2 and M2.1 models via Anthropic-compatible API ([#656](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/656) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))
- Add Amazon Bedrock provider with prompt caching for Claude models (experimental, tested with Anthropic Claude models only) ([#494](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/494) by [@unexge](https://github.com/unexge))
- Added `serviceTier` option for OpenAI Responses requests ([#672](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/672) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- **Anthropic caching on OpenRouter**: Interactions with Anthropic models via OpenRouter now set a 5-minute cache point using Anthropic-style `cache_control` breakpoints on the last assistant or user message. ([#584](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/584) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))
- **Google Gemini CLI provider improvements**: Added Antigravity endpoint fallback (tries daily sandbox then prod when `baseUrl` is unset), header-based retry delay parsing (`Retry-After`, `x-ratelimit-reset`, `x-ratelimit-reset-after`), stable `sessionId` derivation from first user message for cache affinity, empty SSE stream retry with backoff, and `anthropic-beta` header for Claude thinking models ([#670](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/670) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.44.0] - 2026-01-12

## [0.43.0] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed

- Fixed Google provider thinking detection: `isThinkingPart()` now only checks `thought === true`, not `thoughtSignature`. Per Google docs, `thoughtSignature` is for context replay and can appear on any part type. Also removed `id` field from `functionCall`/`functionResponse` (rejected by Vertex AI and Cloud Code Assist), and added `textSignature` round-trip for multi-turn reasoning context. ([#631](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/631) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

## [0.42.5] - 2026-01-11

## [0.42.4] - 2026-01-10

## [0.42.3] - 2026-01-10

### Changed

- OpenAI Codex: switched to bundled system prompt matching opencode, changed originator to "pi", simplified prompt handling

## [0.42.2] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- Added `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env var support for Vertex AI credential detection (standard for CI/production).
- Added `supportsUsageInStreaming` compatibility flag for OpenAI-compatible providers that reject `stream_options: { include_usage: true }`. Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` in model config for providers like gatewayz.ai. ([#596](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/596) by [@XesGaDeus](https://github.com/XesGaDeus))
- Improved Google model pricing info ([#588](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/588) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))

### Fixed

- Fixed `os.homedir()` calls at module load time; now resolved lazily when needed.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses tool strict flag to use a boolean for LM Studio compatibility ([#598](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/598) by [@gnattu](https://github.com/gnattu))
- Fixed Google Cloud Code Assist OAuth for paid subscriptions: properly handles long-running operations for project provisioning, supports `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` / `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` env vars for paid tiers, and handles VPC-SC affected users ([#582](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/582) by [@cmf](https://github.com/cmf))

## [0.42.1] - 2026-01-09

## [0.42.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- Added OpenCode Zen provider support with 26 models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, etc.). Set `OPENCODE_API_KEY` env var to use.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-01-09

## [0.40.1] - 2026-01-09

## [0.40.0] - 2026-01-08

## [0.39.1] - 2026-01-08

## [0.39.0] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

- Fixed Gemini CLI abort handling: detect native `AbortError` in retry catch block, cancel SSE reader when abort signal fires ([#568](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/568) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))
- Fixed Antigravity provider 429 errors by aligning request payload with CLIProxyAPI v6.6.89: inject Antigravity system instruction with `role: "user"`, set `requestType: "agent"`, and use `antigravity` userAgent. Added bridge prompt to override Antigravity behavior (identity, paths, web dev guidelines) with Pi defaults. ([#571](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/571) by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas))
- Fixed thinking block handling for cross-model conversations: thinking blocks are now converted to plain text (no `<thinking>` tags) when switching models. Previously, `<thinking>` tags caused models to mimic the pattern and output literal tags. Also fixed empty thinking blocks causing API errors. ([#561](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/561))

## [0.38.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- `thinkingBudgets` option in `SimpleStreamOptions` for customizing token budgets per thinking level on token-based providers ([#529](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/529) by [@melihmucuk](https://github.com/melihmucuk))

### Breaking Changes

- Removed OpenAI Codex model aliases (`gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, `codex-mini-latest`, `gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5.1-chat-latest`). Use canonical model IDs: `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-codex`. ([#536](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/536) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr))

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex context window from 400,000 to 272,000 tokens to match Codex CLI defaults and prevent 400 errors. ([#536](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/536) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr))
- Fixed Codex SSE error events to surface message, code, and status. ([#551](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/551) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))
- Fixed context overflow detection for `context_length_exceeded` error codes.

## [0.37.8] - 2026-01-07

## [0.37.7] - 2026-01-07

## [0.37.6] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- Exported OpenAI Codex utilities: `CacheMetadata`, `getCodexInstructions`, `getModelFamily`, `ModelFamily`, `buildCodexPiBridge`, `buildCodexSystemPrompt`, `CodexSystemPrompt` ([#510](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/510) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

## [0.37.5] - 2026-01-06

## [0.37.4] - 2026-01-06

## [0.37.3] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- `sessionId` option in `StreamOptions` for providers that support session-based caching. OpenAI Codex provider uses this to set `prompt_cache_key` and routing headers.

## [0.37.2] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- Codex provider now always includes `reasoning.encrypted_content` even when custom `include` options are passed ([#484](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/484) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.37.1] - 2026-01-05

## [0.37.0] - 2026-01-05

### Breaking Changes

- OpenAI Codex models no longer have per-thinking-level variants (e.g., `gpt-5.2-codex-high`). Use the base model ID and set thinking level separately. The Codex provider clamps reasoning effort to what each model supports internally. (initial implementation by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas) in [#472](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/472))

### Added

- Headless OAuth support for all callback-server providers (Google Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenAI Codex): paste redirect URL when browser callback is unreachable ([#428](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/428) by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas), [#468](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/468) by [@crcatala](https://github.com/crcatala))
- Cancellable GitHub Copilot device code polling via AbortSignal

### Fixed

- Codex requests now omit the `reasoning` field entirely when thinking is off, letting the backend use its default instead of forcing a value. ([#472](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/472))

## [0.36.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- OpenAI Codex OAuth provider with Responses API streaming support: `openai-codex-responses` streaming provider with SSE parsing, tool-call handling, usage/cost tracking, and PKCE OAuth flow ([#451](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/451) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- Vertex AI dummy value for `getEnvApiKey()`: Returns `"<authenticated>"` when Application Default Credentials are configured (`~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` exists) and both `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` (or `GCLOUD_PROJECT`) and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` are set. This allows `streamSimple()` to work with Vertex AI without explicit `apiKey` option. The ADC credentials file existence check is cached per-process to avoid repeated filesystem access.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-01-05

## [0.34.2] - 2026-01-04

## [0.34.1] - 2026-01-04

## [0.34.0] - 2026-01-04

## [0.33.0] - 2026-01-04

## [0.32.3] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- Google Vertex AI models no longer appear in available models list without explicit authentication. Previously, `getEnvApiKey()` returned a dummy value for `google-vertex`, causing models to show up even when Google Cloud ADC was not configured.

## [0.32.2] - 2026-01-03

## [0.32.1] - 2026-01-03

## [0.32.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- Vertex AI provider with ADC (Application Default Credentials) support. Authenticate with `gcloud auth application-default login`, set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, and access Gemini models via Vertex AI. ([#300](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/300) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))

### Fixed

- **Gemini CLI rate limit handling**: Added automatic retry with server-provided delay for 429 errors. Parses delay from error messages like "Your quota will reset after 39s" and waits accordingly. Falls back to exponential backoff for other transient errors. ([#370](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/370))

## [0.31.1] - 2026-01-02

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Breaking Changes

- **Agent API moved**: All agent functionality (`agentLoop`, `agentLoopContinue`, `AgentContext`, `AgentEvent`, `AgentTool`, `AgentToolResult`, etc.) has moved to `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`. Import from that package instead of `@mariozechner/pi-ai`.

### Added

- **`GoogleThinkingLevel` type**: Exported type that mirrors Google's `ThinkingLevel` enum values (`"THINKING_LEVEL_UNSPECIFIED" | "MINIMAL" | "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH"`). Allows configuring Gemini thinking levels without importing from `@google/genai`.
- **`ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` env var**: Now checked before `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `getEnvApiKey()`, allowing OAuth tokens to take precedence.
- **`event-stream.js` export**: `AssistantMessageEventStream` utility now exported from package index.

### Changed

- **OAuth uses Web Crypto API**: PKCE generation and OAuth flows now use Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle`) instead of Node.js `crypto` module. This improves browser compatibility while still working in Node.js 20+.
- **Deterministic model generation**: `generate-models.ts` now sorts providers and models alphabetically for consistent output across runs. ([#332](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/332) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia))

### Fixed

- **OpenAI completions empty content blocks**: Empty text or thinking blocks in assistant messages are now filtered out before sending to the OpenAI completions API, preventing validation errors. ([#344](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/344) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))
- **Thinking token duplication**: Fixed thinking content duplication with chutes.ai provider. The provider was returning thinking content in both `reasoning_content` and `reasoning` fields, causing each chunk to be processed twice. Now only the first non-empty reasoning field is used.
- **zAi provider API mapping**: Fixed zAi models to use `openai-completions` API with correct base URL (`https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4`) instead of incorrect Anthropic API mapping. ([#344](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/344), [#358](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/358) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))

## [0.28.0] - 2025-12-25

### Breaking Changes

- **OAuth storage removed** ([#296](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/296)): All storage functions (`loadOAuthCredentials`, `saveOAuthCredentials`, `setOAuthStorage`, etc.) removed. Callers are responsible for storing credentials.
- **OAuth login functions**: `loginAnthropic`, `loginGitHubCopilot`, `loginGeminiCli`, `loginAntigravity` now return `OAuthCredentials` instead of saving to disk.
- **refreshOAuthToken**: Now takes `(provider, credentials)` and returns new `OAuthCredentials` instead of saving.
- **getOAuthApiKey**: Now takes `(provider, credentials)` and returns `{ newCredentials, apiKey }` or null.
- **OAuthCredentials type**: No longer includes `type: "oauth"` discriminator. Callers add discriminator when storing.
- **setApiKey, resolveApiKey**: Removed. Callers must manage their own API key storage/resolution.
- **getApiKey**: Renamed to `getEnvApiKey`. Only checks environment variables for known providers.

## [0.27.7] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **Thinking tag leakage**: Fixed Claude mimicking literal `</thinking>` tags in responses. Unsigned thinking blocks (from aborted streams) are now converted to plain text without `<thinking>` tags. The TUI still displays them as thinking blocks. ([#302](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/302) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

## [0.25.1] - 2025-12-21

### Added

- **xhigh thinking level support**: Added `supportsXhigh()` function to check if a model supports xhigh reasoning level. Also clamps xhigh to high for OpenAI models that don't support it. ([#236](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/236) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

### Fixed

- **Gemini multimodal tool results**: Fixed images in tool results causing flaky/broken responses with Gemini models. For Gemini 3, images are now nested inside `functionResponse.parts` per the [docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#multimodal). For older models (which don't support multimodal function responses), images are sent in a separate user message.

- **Queued message steering**: When `getQueuedMessages` is provided, the agent loop now checks for queued user messages after each tool call and skips remaining tool calls in the current assistant message when a queued message arrives (emitting error tool results).

- **Double API version path in Google provider URL**: Fixed Gemini API calls returning 404 after baseUrl support was added. The SDK was appending its default apiVersion to baseUrl which already included the version path. ([#251](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/251) by [@shellfyred](https://github.com/shellfyred))

- **Anthropic SDK retries disabled**: Re-enabled SDK-level retries (default 2) for transient HTTP failures. ([#252](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/252))

## [0.23.5] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- **Gemini 3 Flash thinking support**: Extended thinking level support for Gemini 3 Flash models (MINIMAL, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) to match Pro models' capabilities. ([#212](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/212) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

- **GitHub Copilot thinking models**: Added thinking support for additional Copilot models (o3-mini, o1-mini, o1-preview). ([#234](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/234) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))

### Fixed

- **Gemini tool result format**: Fixed tool result format for Gemini 3 Flash Preview which strictly requires `{ output: value }` for success and `{ error: value }` for errors. Previous format using `{ result, isError }` was rejected by newer Gemini models. Also improved type safety by removing `as any` casts. ([#213](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/213), [#220](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/220))

- **Google baseUrl configuration**: Google provider now respects `baseUrl` configuration for custom endpoints or API proxies. ([#216](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/216), [#221](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/221) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

- **GitHub Copilot vision requests**: Added `Copilot-Vision-Request` header when sending images to GitHub Copilot models. ([#222](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/222))

- **GitHub Copilot X-Initiator header**: Fixed X-Initiator logic to check last message role instead of any message in history. This ensures proper billing when users send follow-up messages. ([#209](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/209))

## [0.22.3] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Image limits test suite**: Added comprehensive tests for provider-specific image limitations (max images, max size, max dimensions). Discovered actual limits: Anthropic (100 images, 5MB, 8000px), OpenAI (500 images, ≥25MB), Gemini (~2500 images, ≥40MB), Mistral (8 images, ~15MB), OpenRouter (~40 images context-limited, ~15MB). ([#120](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/120))

- **Tool result streaming**: Added `tool_execution_update` event and optional `onUpdate` callback to `AgentTool.execute()` for streaming tool output during execution. Tools can now emit partial results (e.g., bash stdout) that are forwarded to subscribers. ([#44](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/44))

- **X-Initiator header for GitHub Copilot**: Added X-Initiator header handling for GitHub Copilot provider to ensure correct call accounting (agent calls are not deducted from quota). Sets initiator based on last message role. ([#200](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/200) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Changed

- **Normalized tool_execution_end result**: `tool_execution_end` event now always contains `AgentToolResult` (no longer `AgentToolResult | string`). Errors are wrapped in the standard result format.

### Fixed

- **Reasoning disabled by default**: When `reasoning` option is not specified, thinking is now explicitly disabled for all providers. Previously, some providers like Gemini with "dynamic thinking" would use their default (thinking ON), causing unexpected token usage. This was the original intended behavior. ([#180](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/180) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.22.2] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **Interleaved thinking for Anthropic**: Added `interleavedThinking` option to `AnthropicOptions`. When enabled, Claude 4 models can think between tool calls and reason after receiving tool results. Enabled by default (no extra token cost, just unlocks the capability). Set `interleavedThinking: false` to disable.

## [0.22.1] - 2025-12-15

_Dedicated to Peter's shoulder ([@steipete](https://twitter.com/steipete))_

### Added

- **Interleaved thinking for Anthropic**: Enabled interleaved thinking in the Anthropic provider, allowing Claude models to output thinking blocks interspersed with text responses.

## [0.22.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot provider**: Added `github-copilot` as a known provider with models sourced from models.dev. Includes Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, and other models available through GitHub Copilot. ([#191](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/191) by [@cau1k](https://github.com/cau1k))

### Fixed

- **GitHub Copilot gpt-5 models**: Fixed API selection for gpt-5 models to use `openai-responses` instead of `openai-completions` (gpt-5 models are not accessible via completions endpoint)

- **GitHub Copilot cross-model context handoff**: Fixed context handoff failing when switching between GitHub Copilot models using different APIs (e.g., gpt-5 to claude-sonnet-4). Tool call IDs from OpenAI Responses API were incompatible with other models. ([#198](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/198))

- **Gemini 3 Pro thinking levels**: Thinking level configuration now works correctly for Gemini 3 Pro models. Previously all levels mapped to -1 (minimal thinking). Now LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH properly control test-time computation. ([#176](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/176) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.18.2] - 2025-12-11

### Changed

- **Anthropic SDK retries disabled**: Set `maxRetries: 0` on Anthropic client to allow application-level retry handling. The SDK's built-in retries were interfering with coding-agent's retry logic. ([#157](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/157))

## [0.18.1] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **Mistral provider**: Added support for Mistral AI models via the OpenAI-compatible API. Includes automatic handling of Mistral-specific requirements (tool call ID format). Set `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable to use.

### Fixed

- Fixed Mistral 400 errors after aborted assistant messages by skipping empty assistant messages (no content, no tool calls) ([#165](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/165))

- Removed synthetic assistant bridge message after tool results for Mistral (no longer required as of Dec 2025) ([#165](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/165))

- Fixed bug where `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable was deleted globally after first OAuth token usage, causing subsequent prompts to fail ([#164](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/164))

## [0.17.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- **`agentLoopContinue` function**: Continue an agent loop from existing context without adding a new user message. Validates that the last message is `user` or `toolResult`. Useful for retry after context overflow or resuming from manually-added tool results.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed provider-level tool argument validation. Validation now happens in `agentLoop` via `executeToolCalls`, allowing models to retry on validation errors. For manual tool execution, use `validateToolCall(tools, toolCall)` or `validateToolArguments(tool, toolCall)`.

### Added

- Added `validateToolCall(tools, toolCall)` helper that finds the tool by name and validates arguments.

- **OpenAI compatibility overrides**: Added `compat` field to `Model` for `openai-completions` API, allowing explicit configuration of provider quirks (`supportsStore`, `supportsDeveloperRole`, `supportsReasoningEffort`, `maxTokensField`). Falls back to URL-based detection if not set. Useful for LiteLLM, custom proxies, and other non-standard endpoints. ([#133](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/133), thanks @fink-andreas for the initial idea and PR)

- **xhigh reasoning level**: Added `xhigh` to `ReasoningEffort` type for OpenAI codex-max models. For non-OpenAI providers (Anthropic, Google), `xhigh` is automatically mapped to `high`. ([#143](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/143))

### Changed

- **Updated SDK versions**: OpenAI SDK 5.21.0 → 6.10.0, Anthropic SDK 0.61.0 → 0.71.2, Google GenAI SDK 1.30.0 → 1.31.0

## [0.13.0] - 2025-12-06

### Breaking Changes

- **Added `totalTokens` field to `Usage` type**: All code that constructs `Usage` objects must now include the `totalTokens` field. This field represents the total tokens processed by the LLM (input + output + cache). For OpenAI and Google, this uses native API values (`total_tokens`, `totalTokenCount`). For Anthropic, it's computed as `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite`.

## [0.12.10] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.1-codex-max` model support

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Token Counting**: Fixed `usage.input` to exclude cached tokens for OpenAI providers. Previously, `input` included cached tokens, causing double-counting when calculating total context size via `input + cacheRead`. Now `input` represents non-cached input tokens across all providers, making `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite` the correct formula for total context size.

- **Fixed Claude Opus 4.5 cache pricing** (was 3x too expensive)
  - Corrected cache_read: $1.50 → $0.50 per MTok
  - Corrected cache_write: $18.75 → $6.25 per MTok
  - Added manual override in `scripts/generate-models.ts` until upstream fix is merged
  - Submitted PR to models.dev: https://github.com/sst/models.dev/pull/439

## [0.9.4] - 2025-11-26

Initial release with multi-provider LLM support.
